                        AERMAP (dated 11103)

This Model Change Bulletin documents changes made to the AERMAP Terrain 
Preprocessor for the AERMOD Dispersion Model.  A brief description of 
the changes is provided below.  Additional details are also available 
in the Fortran source code.  


This revised version of AERMAP (dated 11103) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (dated 11059):

-- Bug Fixes:

   1.  Corrected formatting issue for message indicating that 
       source location is not assigned to a terrain file, in
       sub_demsrc. This error condition resulted in a Fortran
       runtime error with version 09040.


-- Enhancements:

   1.  Modified several subroutines to increase maximum length 
       of source IDs from 8 to 12 characters, to be consistent
       with enhancement introduced with version 11059 of AERMOD.


-- Miscellaneous:

   1.  Modified subroutine ERRHDL to set an upper limit on line 
       number included in error messages to avoid overflowing 
       the field.

This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: AERMAP (dated 11103).  Future changes to this model will be 
identified by an updated Julian date found at the beginning of the model
source code and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin
(MCB#n) which will explain the nature and content of the changes.  All 
Model Change Bulletins for this program will always be available for back
reference on this website.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs)
to this program will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this website.
