                        AERMET (dated 06341)

This Model Change Bulletin documents changes made to the AERMET 
Meteorological Preprocessor for the AERMOD Dispersion Model.  A brief 
description of the changes is provided below.  Additional details are 
also available through comments imbedded in the Fortran source code; 
the latter are cross referenced in an annotated list of changes which 
accompanies the source code. Changes to the user instructions associated
with this update are documented in a separate AERMET User's Guide 
Addendum.


   This revised version of AERMET (dated 06341) includes the following
   modifications relative to the previous version (dated 04300):                                                       
                                                                        
   Bug Fixes:                                                           

   1.  Corrected several problems associated with the extraction and 
       processing of Integrated Surface Hourly Data (a.k.a., ISHD, ISH, 
       ISD, TD-3505), including:
       
       a) Modified the procedure for selecting which record to process
          for hours with multiple records, including treatment of 
          "special" observation records - AERMET now uses the last
          record up to and including the hour, but will only use a
          "special" observation (types FM-15 or SAOSP) if the only
          observation available for the hour is a "special";
          
       b) Corrected code for processing of sky cover data fields;
       
       c) Corrected initialization of "additional" character variable 
          to avoid data fields from previous hours being used;
          
       d) Added code for identifying "variable" winds with valid wind 
          speed but missing wind direction (formerly flagged as calms);
          
       e) Modified to include additional observation types as acceptable
          for processing to avoid skipping valid data;
       
       f) Corrected problem that would cause the observation hour to 
          be incremented prematurely, resulting in valid data being
          overwritten in some cases;
          
       g) Corrected the code for estimating station pressure and 
          sea-level pressure when one or the other is missing;
          
       h) Added code to check for "missing" station elevation (9999)
          for files that have been expanded to include location fields
          using the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) utility
          program.  If a missing elevation is found, then AERMET will
          use the assigned value based on the optional elevation field
          on the LOCATION card, if available.  If the LOCATION 
          elevation field is omitted, the assigned value is defaulted 
          to 100m .  See Items 2 and 3a under "Enhancements" below 
          for related information.

       i) Modified subroutines RDISHD and ISHWX for processing of ISHD 
          surface format "present weather" data codes to determine 
          precipitation type code (liquid or frozen).
          
   2.  Modified the upper and lower bounds for the surface level 
       pressure in subroutine GETFSL to avoid skipping valid upper 
       air soundings for stations located at high or low elevations.
       
   3.  Modified subroutine RDHUSW to correct the missing data codes for 
       wind speed and direction for HUSWO surface data.
       
   4.  Modified subroutine D3280L to assign the correct missing data 
       code for missing wind direction, and to also process variable 
       wind code with valid wind speed but missing wind direction.
       
   5.  Modified subroutines MPPBL and NR_ANG to correct problems with 
       calculation of critical solar angle (ACRIT), including modifications 
       to handling of missing data in the calculation of ACRIT.
       
   6.  Revised format statement in subroutine REALQA to avoid overflowing
       the message field.
       
   7.  Revised subroutine SMTHZI to include a limit on the exponential 
       argument to avoid a runtime underflow and to use the correct
       missing data code for ustar.
       
   8.  Revised subroutine RDSAMS to correct the format statement for a 
       character variable.
   
   Enhancements:                                                        
                                                                        
   1.  Modified code to use a single AERMET.EXE executable file, 
       replacing the separate STAGE1N2 and STAGE3 executables.  Note
       this only affects the number of executables; users must still 
       run each stage separately.  The new AERMET executable is also 
       hardcoded to read the input data from an 'AERMET.INP' file, but
       the format of the input files has not changed, other than the
       enhancement noted in Item 2 below.

   2.  The code for processing the 'LOCATION' input image has been 
       revised to allow users the option of including station elevation 
       in the last field of the input image. This addresses potential
       problems related to the estimation of surface pressure from 
       sea-level pressure when processing surface data in the ISHD
       format.  The optional user-specified elevation from the 
       LOCATION card is currently used only to substitute for 
       missing elevation values in the ISHD data format for the
       SURFACE pathway.  Optional elevation values input for other
       surface data formats or for the UPPERAIR, ONSITE and METPREP
       pathways are currenlty ignored.

   3.  Revised code for extracting and processing surface data in the
       ISHD format as follows:
       
       a) The format of every record is checked to determine whether 
          the record includes station location and elevation.  This will 
          allow users to process 'mixed-format' files, such as would be 
          created by appending records in one format to a data file 
          comprised of records in the other format;
          
       b) Overwritten hourly records are saved by writing them to the 
          error/message file; and
       
       c) Added a counter to track the number of hourly records with 
          a variable wind direction flag.

   Miscellaneous:                                                       
                                                                        
   1.  Modified several subroutines to impose a lower limit on the
       value of surface roughness length of 0.001 meters, for consistency
       with the AERMOD dispersion model.
       
   2.  The optional user-specified time window for extracting and
       processing ISHD surface data has been removed, and the default
       extraction window has been increased from 10 minutes to 30
       minutes preceding the hour.
       
   3.  Added code to subroutines SUBST and MPPBL to trap on problem with
       determining the wind direction sector for surface characteristics
       to avoid compiler runtime errors. Such a condition should not occur, 
       but could indicate a problem with data formatting or with the 
       AERMET code.

This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: AERMET (dated 06341).  Future changes to AERMET will be identified
by an updated Julian date found at the beginning of the source code
and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n)
which will explain the nature and content of the changes.  All Model Change
Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference on
this website.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this program
will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this website.
