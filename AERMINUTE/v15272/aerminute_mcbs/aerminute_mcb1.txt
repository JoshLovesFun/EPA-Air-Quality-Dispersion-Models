                        AERMINUTE (dated 11325)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERMINUTE 
1-minute ASOS wind data processor.  A brief description of the changes  
is provided below.Additional details are available in the FORTRAN source code 
and in the AERMINUTE user's guide.


This revised version of AERMINUTE (dated 11325) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (11059):

Modifications

1.  Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to adjust quality control flags 3,
    4, and 5 when checking the wind data line format. Flag 3 was modified to  
    better checkfor four digit character strings that may indicate a possible   
    time. In version 11059 of AERMINUTE, any four digit string was considered a 
    possible time.  In version 11325, the string is only considered a possible 
    time if the entire four digit string is a complete integer string, i.e. 
    1105 would be a possible time but not 110503.  If a possible time
    is found flag 3 is set to one, otherwise flag 3 is zero. 
    Flag 4 previously checked for an 'M', 'N', or 'D' in column 39.  
    Flag 4 now checks for a non-blank character in column 30. If column 
    30 contains a non-blank character, then flag 4 is set to one.  
    Otherwise, flag 4 is zero.   Flag 5 as modified to look for
     any non-blank character in column 67 of 
    the data line.  If a non-blank character is found in column 67
    flag 5 is set to one, otherwise flag 5 is zero.  For any of the
    three flags, if a value is one, the record is considered suspicious
    and not used in hourly averaging.  The record is output to 
    check_records.dat
