                        AERMINUTE (dated 14337)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERMINUTE 
1-minute ASOS wind data processor.  A brief description of the changes  
is provided below.Additional details are available in the FORTRAN source code 
and in the AERMINUTE user's guide.


This revised version of AERMINUTE (dated 14337) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (14237):

Modifications

1. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to remove the check on column 67 for non-blank 
   character and columns 64-68 for non-blank characters.  Flags 6-12 were 
   renumbered accordingly, flags 6-9 became flags 5-8 and flags 11 and 12 
   became flags 9 and 10.

2. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to search columns 68-90 for non-numeric columns 
   for flag 1.  The check was originally columns 67-90.

3. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to decrease the size of variables aflag 
   and iflag1 from 13 to 11.

4. Modified module MAIN1 to reset variable flagcounts from size 14 to 12

5. Modified subroutine READONE to reset variable flagstr from size 14 to 12 
   and included descriptions of modified flags.

6. Modified subroutine READLINE to decrease length of variable aflag from 
   13 to 11 to accommodate new flags.
