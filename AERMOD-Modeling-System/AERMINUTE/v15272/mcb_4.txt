This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERMINUTE 
1-minute ASOS wind data processor.  A brief description of the changes  
is provided below.Additional details are available in the FORTRAN source code 
and in the AERMINUTE user's guide.


This revised version of AERMINUTE (dated 14337) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (14337):

Enhancements

1. Modified subroutine USERINP to read in optional 5-minute data ASOS files
2. Modified subroutine USERINP to allow for no-1minute data listing as long as
   opotinal 5-minute data files are listed.
3. Modified subroutine USERINP to allow for optional output files, SUB5FILE and
   1_5_FILE.
4, Added subroutine CHECKWBAN to check WBAN numbers for non-numeric characters in
   1-minute and 5-minute data files
5. Added subroutine SUB5 to substitute missing 1-minute data values with corresponding
   5-minute data values
Modifications

1. Modified subroutine CHECKFILES to perform QA on 1-minute or optional 5-minute
   data files.
2. Modified subroutine WRITEOUT to include 5-minute data summaries in SUMMARY file
   and output file.
3. Modified subroutine MINMAXONE to include source of minimum and maximum 2-minute
   winds, i.e. 1-minute or 5-minute data file.
4. Modified subroutine HOURLYMINMAX to include source of data (1-minute or 5-minute)
   for hourly minimum and maximum 2-minute wind speeds and directions.
5. Modified module MAIN1, subroutine INITIAL, and subroutine CLEANUP to include
