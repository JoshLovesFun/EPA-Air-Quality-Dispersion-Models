This file includes the Fortran source code, user's guide and executable for
AERMINUTE (dated 15272, 09/29/2015), the 1-minute 
ASOS wind data processor.  

The AERMINUTE program processes 1-minute ASOS wind data available from the 
National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in the TD-6405 or TD-6401 format to 
generate hourly averaged wind speed and wind direction to supplement the 
standard hourly ASOS observations. The hourly averaged wind speed and direction 
generated by the AERMINUTE program can be merged with data from standard surface 
archives, such as ISHD, along with upper air and site-specific data (if available) 
in Stage 2 of AERMET processing.
