                                MCB#3                       10/19/2009

                        AERMOD (dated 09292)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERMOD
Dispersion Model.  A brief description of the changes is provided
below.  Additional details are available in the Fortran source code.
Changes to the user instructions associated with this update are
documented in an updated AERMOD User's Guide Addendum.


This revised version of AERMOD (dated 09292) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (dated 07026):

-- Bug Fixes:

   1.  Modified subroutine OLM_CALC to correct initialization
       problem with OLMGROUP keyword option.  The NO2VAL and NO_VAL
       arrays need to be reinitialized for each receptor when the
       OLMGROUP keyword is used.  This bug may result in significant
       errors in concentration estimates for applications of the
       OLM option with OLMGROUPs.  More details regarding this bug
       are provided below in the Addendum to MCB#3.

   2.  Modified subroutine CHK_ENDYR to check for allocation
       status of allocatable arrays during array initializations;
       this has caused runtime errors on some compilers related to
       initializing unallocated ALLOCATABLE arrays when ANNUAL or
       PERIOD averages were calculated.

   3.  Modified ISSTAT() array indices in subroutine SOCARD to
       eliminate potential conflicts among different options
       referencing the same index.

   4.  Modified subroutine MEOPEN to correct problems with
       processing of the 'SCREEN' option in the AERMET version
       date field of the header record of the surface file to 
       support the use of screening meteorological data with 
       AERSCREEN.

   5.  Modified subroutine SETIDG to use 'I8' format for an internal
       read of the source group ID from NUMID to avoid runtime errors 
       with some compilers.

   6.  Modified subroutines METEXT and MEREAD to include a more
       robust check for stable or missing hours in calculation
       of solar irradiance (QSW) for use in dry deposition
       calculations.

   7.  Modified subroutine OUTQA to correct write statement for
       message '540' to accommodate MONTH average option, labeled
       as 720-hr option. Also modified subroutine OUTQA to include
       error checking for file name and file unit conflicts across
       output file options.

   8.  Modified subroutines OUMXFL, OUPOST, OUPLOT, PERPST, PERPLT,
       OUTOXX, OUSEAS, OURANK, and OUEVAL to set lower limit for
       acceptable user-specified file units to 31, in order to avoid
       potential conflicts with hardcoded file units.  Also modified
       file units for deposition debug files to be within the range
       established for hardcoded file units.

   9.  Modified subroutine METH_2 to check for out-of-range inputs
       for fine mass fraction (finemass) for the Method 2 particle
       deposition option.

  10.  Modified subroutine PLUME_VOL to include a call to subroutine
       PENFCT to calculate plume penetration factor.  This corrects
       potential errors with the PVMRM option for penetrated plumes.

  11.  Modified subroutine SIGZ to include a check on the sign of
       TGEFF before calculation of BVFRQ to avoid potential runtime
       errors.

  12.  Modified subroutine SRCQA to check for source being defined
       as both particulate and gaseous.  Also modified SRCQA to check
       for invalid shape of AREAPOLY source, identified with
       an area = 0.

  13.  Modified subroutine VDP1 to output ZRDEP instead of undefined
       variable ZREF under the "debug" option.

  14.  Modified subroutine METQA to include error checking for a
       value of wind speed reference height (UREFHT) of less than
       0.001m for non-missing and non-calm hours. Fatal error issued
       to avoid runtime errors that may occur for values entered as
       zero.

  15.  Modified several subroutines to address potential problems
       related to options that assume full years of meteorological
       data.  This includes modifications to subroutines STAEND and 
       METEXT for setting the month, day, and hour for the "end of 
       the year", based on the first hour of the meteorological data 
       file or on the STARTEND keyword, to resolve potential problems 
       for PM-2.5 and ANNUAL average applications in which the 
       "starting hour" is not 01.  Modified subroutine METEXT to 
       determine "end of the year" for the MULTYEAR option, and 
       modified subroutine HRLOOP to call CHK_ENDYR for the MULTYEAR 
       option to allow error checking for use of incomplete years or 
       periods longer than a year with the MULTYEAR option.  Modified 
       subroutine RSINIT to adjust the "starting hour" read from a 
       re-start file (based on the INITFILE or MULTYEAR keyword) by 
       adding 1 hour for the re-started model run.  Also improved the 
       error handling in subroutine STAEND for user-specified start and
       end dates, including a check for the user-specified STARTEND
       period being less than 1 complete year when the ANNUAL average
       option and/or the MULTYEAR option are specified, resulting
       in a setup error.

  16.  Modified code in subroutines RSINIT and METEXT to include
       checks for potential conflicts between the first date of met
       data file or the user-specified start date on STARTEND keyword
       being later than the "start date" from a re-start file.  This 
       data gap results in a fatal error message for INITFILE re-starts
       and a warning message for MULTYEAR re-starts.  Also checks for
       overlapping periods for MULTYEAR applications with start date
       from STARTEND keyword being earlier than start date from the 
       MULTYEAR re-start file.  This condition results in a fatal error
       message.

  17.  Modified subruotines METEXT and MEREAD to check for the
       meteorological data file starting hour, and issue appropriate
       warnings regarding short-term averages for the first day
       of data if the starting hour is not 01, since they may
       represent partial data periods.  Modifications were also
       made to subroutine MEREAD to cycle through the meteorological
       data file until the hour matches the hour loop index for
       EVENT processing.

  18.  Modified MAIN program to adjust the order of calls to
       subroutine RSDUMP to write results arrays to the SAVEFILE
       for ANNUAL averages and for PERIOD averages with the MULTYEAR
       option.  These adjustments ensure that the summary of overall
       maximum PERIOD averages with the MULTYEAR option are based on
       the maximum individual PERIOD values across the years processed, 
       while the maximum ANNUAL averages reflect the multi-year 
       average of the ANNUAL values across the years processed.  
       The order of calculating averages by season and hour-of-day 
       with the SEASONHR option was also adjusted to ensure that the 
       SEASONHR averages are correct across the years of data processed.
       Subroutine PRTSUM was modified to include a message in the
       summary tables of maximum PERIOD and high ranked short-term
       averages to indicate the number of years represented by the
       results when the MULTYEAR option is used.  Subroutine PRTOPT
       was also modified to clarify what PERIOD averages represent
       when the MULTYEAR option is used.

  19.  Modified several subrountines, including HRLOOP, METEXT,
       HRQREAD, O3READ, and O3EXT, to provide additional error
       handling for premature "end-of-file" (EOF) condition for
       input meteorological data, hourly emissions data (HOUREMIS
       keyword), and ozone data files.  A fatal error is generated 
       if the data files end before the "end date" specified by the 
       user on the STARTEND keyword.

  20.  Modified subroutines OUMXFL and OUPOST to correct problems
       with MAXIFILE and POSTFILE outputs for re-started model
       runs using the SAVEFILE/INITFILE option.  The previous
       version of AERMOD used the 8-digit date from the MAXIFILE
       and POSTFILE files to compare with the "full" 10-digit
       date read from the INITFILE, and also read the 8-digit
       date from the wrong columns for POSTFILEs.  Also added
       error handling for missing MAXIFILE and/or POSTFILE
       files with INITFILE option, and for MAXIFILE and/or
       POSTFILE files with data past the start date for the
       MULTYEAR option.

  21.  Modified subroutine INCLUD to include the EV pathway to
       ensure proper handling of INCLUDED files for events on the
       EV pathway.  Also incorporated additional error handling
       for INCLUDED files.

  22.  Modified assignment of ILAND_NDX based on flow vector (AFV)
       in subroutine VDP to be consistent with assignment of the
       flow vector sector for downwash, IFVSEC.

  23.  Modified subroutine OCALC to correct the calculation of the
       adjusted emission rate for the point source approximation
       for OPENPIT sources under the FASTAREA option to use the
       length and width of the "effective" area source rather than
       length and width of the original openpit source.  Also
       modified subroutine ARDIST to recalculate the coordinates
       for the center of the "effective" area source used for the
       OPENPIT source algorithm, rather than using the center
       coordinates of the original OPENPIT source.

  24.  Modified several subroutines to correct and clarify aspects
       of the logic related to use of the deposition algorithms
       for both gas and particle deposition, especially in relation
       to the depletion options for applications including both
       gaseous and particulate emissions.  Previous versions of
       AERMOD would allow a particulate source and a gaseous source
       in the same model run for calculating concentrations only,
       but would indicate that dry and wet depletion were being
       applied, even if no deposition parameters were specified
       for the gaseous source.  The updated version will only
       allow both gaseous and particulate sources in the same model
       run for concentrations if deposition parameters are also
       specified for the gaseous source, or if dry and wet depletion
       are turned off by specifying the NODRYDPLT and NOWETDPLT
       options on the MODELOPT keyword.  Specifying NODRYDPLT and
       NOWETDPLT removes any requirement for deposition parameters
       for the gaseous source.  See the AERMOD User's Guide Addendum
       for more details regarding use of deposition algorithms.

-- Enhancements:

   1.  Incorporated additional options under EMISFACT keyword to
       vary emissions by hour-of-day and day-of-week (HRDOW and
       HRDOW7).

   2.  Improved efficiency of allocating array storage, including
       more precise allocation of array limits for AREAPOLY and
       AREACIRC sources, more precise allocation for number of
       particle size categories for particulate sources, and
       allocating the building downwash arrays only when needed.
       Also included additional informational messages to identify
       where allocation errors occur with a list of array limits
       and preliminary memory storage estimate to facilitate
       diagnosis of problems.  Modifications made to MAIN program,
       MODULE MAIN1, and subroutines ALLSETUP, ALLRESULT, PRESET,
       and SRCSIZ.

   3.  Modified subroutines HRQREAD (renamed from HQREAD), HRQEXT,
       and EV_HRQEXT to allow option of specifying hourly varying
       release height and initial dispersion coefficients for VOLUME
       and AREA sources (including AREAPOLY and AREACIRC) through
       the optional HOUREMIS file.  Also eliminated redundant code
       for processing hourly emission files for 'normal' vs. 'event'
       processing to ensure consistency and simplify code maintenance.

   4.  Increased maximum length for filenames to 200 (controlled by
       the ILEN_FLD parameter in modules.f), and the maximum input
       string length to 512 (controlled by the ISTRG parameter in
       modules.f).  Also modified subroutine DEFINE to allow double
       quotes (") as field delimiters in the 'aermod.inp' file to
       support filenames with embedded spaces.

   5.  Modified subroutines SRCQA and OCALC to allow for use of the
       non-DFAULT METHOD_2 option for particulate emissions and for
       non-particulate (gaseous) emissions for OPENPIT sources.

   6.  Modified several subroutines to allow for the non-DFAULT
       option of FLAT terrain to be specified for individual sources,
       allowing both FLAT and ELEV terrain treatments within the
       same model run (see Section 4.1 of the AERMOD Implementation
       Guide regarding modeling of sources with terrain-following
       plumes in sloped terrain).  This non-DFAULT option is
       activated by specifying both 'ELEV' and 'FLAT' on the
       CO MODELOPT keyword.  The user identifies which sources to
       model with the FLAT terrain option by specifying 'FLAT' (not
       case-sensitive) on the SO LOCATION keyword in place of the
       field for source elevation.  Sources treated as FLAT terrain
       will be identified in the 'aermod.out' file in the summary
       tables of source input parameters.  The 'aermod.out' page
       header of model options, and other output file headers,
       will include the field 'FLAT and ELEV' to identify use
       of this feature.

   7.  Incorporated a non-DFAULT option to optimize model runtime
       for POINT and VOLUME sources through an alternative
       implementation of the horizontal meander algorithm,
       which preserves the centerline concentration based on
       the DFAULT meander algorithm, but uses of an effective
       sigma-y for the lateral spread of the plume. This eliminates
       the upwind component of dispersion that occurs under the
       DFAULT meander algorithm for POINT and VOLUME sources,
       which should significantly reduce model runtime.  This
       option is selected by including 'FASTALL' on the
       CO MODELOPT keyword.  The FASTALL option also activates
       the optimized treatment for AREA sources (including AREAPOLY,
       AREACIRC, and OPENPIT sources) formerly associated with the
       TOXICS option, which is now obsolete (see Item #22 below
       under 'Miscellaneous' and the AERMOD User's Guide Addendum).

   8.  Incorporated non-DFAULT option for user-specified dry
       deposition velocity for gaseous emissions, using the GASDEPVD
       keyword on the CO pathway.  The user-specified dry deposition
       velocity will be used for all gaseous sources.  Particulate
       sources can also be included in the same model run, but no
       wet deposition calculations (WDEP, DEPOS or WETDPLT) will
       be allowed.

   9.  Modified OPEN statements for input data files to use the
       ACTION='READ' specifier to allow file sharing across
       multiple model runs.  This includes the 'aermod.inp' input
       file, INCLUDED files referenced from 'aermod.inp', surface
       and profile meteorological inputs, hourly emission files,
       and hourly ozone data files.

  10.  Added new SUMMFILE option on the OU pathway to output the
       summary of high ranked values to a separate file.  The new
       SUMMFILE includes the "MODEL SETUP OPTIONS SUMMARY" page,
       the summary of meteorological data periods processed and
       summary of first 24 hours of meteorological data, the
       summaries of high ranked values provided at the end of
       the standard output file, and the summary of error and
       warning messages.

  11.  Added new FILEFORM option on the OU pathway to allow
       the user to specify exponential-formatted rather than
       fixed-format output of model results (CONC, DEPOS, DDEP,
       and/or WDEP) for external results files.  Output file
       options affected by this feature are MAXIFILE, PLOTFILE,
       POSTFILE (using PLOT format), RANKFILE, and the SEASONHR
       file.  The default will continue to be fixed format for
       these output files.  Results included in the 'aermod.out'
       file and optional SUMMFILE output file are not affected
       by this new keyword.  Also included checks on values that
       may exceed the output format limit, and a warning message
       is generated if the FILEFORM = EXP option is not used.

  12.  Modified several subroutines to include model run date
       and run time in the header records for output files,
       including the MAXIFILE, PLOTFILE, POSTFILE (using PLOT
       format), RANKFILE, and SEASONHR file options.

  13.  Modified several subroutines to include a new option
       on the MODELOPT keyword to issue warnings rather than
       fatal errors for records out of date sequence in the
       meteorological data files.  The new option is selected
       with the WARNCHKD parameter on the MODELOPT keyword.
       This option is primarily intended for multi-year
       meteorological data files that include gaps between
       years of meteorological data.  The WARNCHKD option is
       allowed under the regulatory DFAULT option, but should
       only be used when processing files with data gaps is
       clearly documented and justified.

-- Miscellaneous:

   1.  Modified subroutine URBOPT to prohibit use of urban roughness
       length not equal to 1.0m for regulatory DFAULT applications,
       as discussed in Section 5.3 of the AERMOD Implementation Guide.
       Also modified limits on urban roughness length to generate
       warning messages.

   2.  Modified code (most modules and subroutines) to explicitly
       declare most non-integer variables as DOUBLE PRECISION.
       This addresses some long-standing concerns regarding the
       potential sensitivity of the model to precision involving
       UTM coordinates, with the full Northing coordinate near
       the limit of single precision.  More serious concerns have
       arisen recently with a case showing a consistent negative
       bias of about 3 percent for modeled concentrations based on
       source group ALL as compared to the sum of concentrations
       from the same sources grouped separately.  These differences
       were attributable to precision errors, with the group ALL
       results biased low due to the impacts from many sources being
       truncated as a result of the wide range of impacts across
       sources.  This change should also result generally in more
       consistent concentration estimates from AERMOD across different
       compilers, compiler options, and computing platforms.

   3.  Modified code in subroutines METEXT and MEREAD for processing
       multi-year meteorological data files to determine whether an
       embedded header record is included between individual calendar
       years of data in the surface file, which may occur if the files
       have been concatenated.  An error while attempting to read
       the data as a header record will be interpreted to mean that
       there is no embedded header record, while the presence of a
       colon (':') will be interpreted to mean that there is an embedded
       header record.  AERMOD should accept data with or without the
       embedded header records.  However, if multi-year surface files
       based on non-calendar year periods are concatenated, then the
       embedded header records must be removed before input to AERMOD.
       The revised code also issues warning messages if UAIR and
       SURF IDs do not match inputs in the runstream file for multiple
       years since AERMOD allows mismatch (with warning) for single
       year files.

   4.  Modified subroutines PRTANN, SPRTHT, and PRTPM25 to include
       EVALCART receptors with DISCCART receptors for output tables.

   5.  Expanded array sizes (in 'modules.f') to 50 for ICSTAT,
       ISSTAT, IRSTAT, IMSTAT, and IOSTAT arrays.  Also changed the
       index used for the FINISHED keyword on each pathway to 50
       instead of 25.

   6.  Removed obsolete code inherited from ISCST3 code, including
       TGSET.FOR and other references to the 'TG' (terrain grid)
       pathway; reference to IRSTAT(7) in subroutine RECARD and
       other references to BOUNDARY receptors in subroutine PRTDAY;
       'HE>ZI' option; and NWET parameter.  Also removed obsolete
       MODULE DEPVAR from the 'modules.f' source file.

   7.  Replaced *.pri "INCLUDE" files used for global data storage
       in PRIME subroutines with MODULE subprograms. The new MODULE
       subprograms are contained in the 'modules.f' source file.
       Also imposed explicit variable type declarations through use
       of IMPLICIT NONE within the PRIME portions of the AERMOD code.

   8.  Incorporated several modifications to subroutine PRTOPT,
       including a more "refined" estimate of memory storage
       requirements, including the DFAULT urban roughness
       length and a more complete summary of options when DFAULT
       option is not specified, correcting cosmetic problems with
       output option summary for EVENT vs. standard processing,
       clarification of deposition option logic, inclusion of
       emission and output units for both concentrations and
       deposition when needed, and more complete explanations
       for some options.

   9.  Modified subroutine SRCQA to issue warning messages for
       sources that are not included in any SRCGROUPs, modified
       checks for urban areas without urban sources, and changed
       warning to fatal error for urban areas with no urban sources.
       Additional error-checking for OLMGROUPs and PSDGROUPSs has
       also been included.

  10.  Modified criterion for issuing a warning message regarding
       aspect ratio for rectangular AREA sources being out of range,
       from an aspect ratio of 10:1 to an aspect ratio of 100:1.
       The upper limit of aspect ratio for stable performance of
       the numerical integration algorithm for area sources has not
       been fully tested and documented, and may vary depending on
       the specifics of the application.  A ratio of 10:1 is probably
       too strict and may unnecessarily lead to a large number of
       warning messages in some cases.  Users should always carefully
       quality assure the source inputs provided to AERMOD for
       accuracy and appropriateness for the application.

  11.  Added error message (number 499) to handle PRIME plume rise
       error when maximum number of downwind distances for numerical
       plume rise (MXNW) is exceeded. This error condition has
       occurred with application of Model Clearinghouse procedure
       for capped stacks (using large effective stack diameter),
       which is not appropriate with PRIME algorithms. Also
       modified subroutine NUMRISE to include additional information
       regarding this error message.

  12.  Modified subroutine PRTSRC to remove reference to "STABILITY
       CATEGORY" and correct format statement 9024 for 'WSPEED'
       EMISFACT option (inherited from legacy ISCST3 code for
       'STAR' option).

  13.  Modified subroutines PPARM, VPARM, APARM, APPARM, ACPARM, and
       OPARM to issue a fatal error message for source release heights
       that exceed 3,000 meters.  Such abnormally high release heights
       have resulted in runtime errors and are considered beyond the
       range of applicability for AERMOD.

  14.  Modified subroutines RANKFL and VARINI to increase number of
       high ranked values allowed in the RANKFILE option without
       overflowing the field, from 999 to 999,999.

  15.  Modified subroutine HEADER in aermod.f to use ASCII
       form feed character (ACHAR(12)) in 'aermod.out' file to
       eliminate need for the non-standard CARRIAGECONTROL='FORTRAN'
       option in the OPEN statement for the 'aermod.out' file.
       Modified subroutine FILOPN to eliminate the use of the
       CARRIAGECONTROL='FORTRAN' option when opening the
       'aermod.out' file.  Also modified subroutine SETUP
       to remove '1X' from format statements for echoing
       the runstream inputs to the output file since Fortran
       carriage-control is no longer applied.  These modifications
       will improve the portability of the AERMOD code to other
       compilers and platforms.

  16.  Modified several subroutines to reflect updates to the
       listing of MODELOPT options based on other modifications
       to the model.  The summary of model options in the page
       header of output files has been modified to more clearly
       indicate when the regulatory default mode (DFAULT) is in
       effect and whether non-DFAULT options are being used for
       applications where the DFAULT option has not been specified.
       Also included error checking for conflicting options being
       included on the MODELOPT keyword, such as the DRYDPLT and
       NODRYDPLT options.

  17.  Modified subroutine PNPOLY to use an Internal Function
       for EOR rather than a Statement Function, which has been
       identified as obsolescent in Fortran 95.

  18.  Modified subroutine METEXT to check for the presence of
       additional variables in the surface meteorological file
       needed for use of the deposition options when required.
       A fatal error is issued if less than the minimum number
       of variables is included in the surface file.

  19.  Modified subroutines SURFIL and PROFIL in meset.f to remove
       the optional user-specified READ format for the surface and
       profile meteorological input files.  AERMOD assumes FREE
       format for all input meteorological data files, i.e., the data
       fields must be space or comma-delimited.  Note that the
       "header" record for the surface file must conform to the
       format used by AERMET.

  20.  Modified subroutines SOLOCA and RECARD to check for missing
       source or receptor elevations, coded as -9999.0 by AERMAP.
       Missing elevations will generate a fatal error, requiring the
       user to resolve the issue(s) associated with the missing
       elevations.

  21.  Modified subroutine FILOPN in aermod.f to use lower case for
       'aermod.inp' and 'aermod.out' files.  Also modified Fortran
       source code filenames to use lower case with '.f' file
       extensions.  These changes may be important for operating
       systems that recognize case-sensitive file names.

  22.  Modified several subroutines to remove the non-DFAULT
       TOXICS option, inherited by AERMOD from the ISCST3 model
       code.  The area source optimizations previously activated
       with the TOXICS option are now associated with the new
       non-DFAULT 'FASTAREA' option, and are also included under
       the new non-DFAULT 'FASTALL' option (see Item #7 above
       under 'Enhancements' and the AERMOD User's Guide Addendum).
       The TOXICS option is no longer required to utilize the
       gas deposition options or the METHOD_2 option for particle
       deposition.  However, these options are still considered
       to be non-DFAULT options within AERMOD.  Also modified
       several subroutines to clarify reporting of deposition
       options in the 'aermod.out' file, including previously
       undocumented options to turn off dry depletion (NODRYDPLT)
       and wet depletion (NOWETDPLT).

  23.  Modified subroutine MODOPT in coset.f to use fatal error
       (message number 204) for several options that conflict
       with the regulatory DFAULT option, including the BETA,
       OLM, PVMRM, PSDCREDIT, SCIM, FASTALL, FASTAREA, and
       AREADPLT options.

  24.  Modified subroutines COCARD and MECARD to skip keywords
       that are not valid for EVENT processing runs, including
       EVENTFIL, SAVEFILE, INITFILE, and MULTYEAR on the CO
       pathway, and STARTEND and DAYRANGE on the ME pathway.
       These keywords are not echoed to the input file created
       with the EVENTFIL keyword, so this change would only
       impact cases where these keywords were added to the
       EVENTFIL after the file was created by the standard
       run, or EVENT input files created through other means.

  25.  Modified subroutines HRQREAD and O3EXT to allow for
       4-digit years in the HOUREMIS and OZONEFIL data files.

  26.  Modified subroutine CHKREC to include a check for
       receptors beyond MAXDIST from sources, using the center
       coordinates for AREA/AREACIRC/AREAPOLY and OPENPIT
       sources.  MAXDIST is set to 80km under the non-DFAULT
       FASTALL and FASTAREA options.

  27.  Modified subroutine MYEAR to treat the 'H6H' field
       for the MULTYEAR keyword as optional, with a warning
       indicating that it is no longer required.

  28.  Modified subroutine METQA to calculate the total
       precipitation amount from the surface met data file.
       Also modified subroutine SUMTBL to include the total
       precipitation amount with the message summary in the
       'aermod.out' file, and included a warning message for
       applications using wet deposition algorithms with a
       total precipitation amount of zero (0).

  29.  Modified subroutine TERRST to determine the number of
       calm and/or missing hours only for the meteorological
       data period being processed when the STARTEND and/or
       DAYRANGE keywords are used.  Also modified subroutine
       SUMTBL to include the number of hours processed from
       the meteorological data file in the message summary.

  30.  Modified subroutines PRTSUM and PRTPM25SUM to adjust the
       format of column headers and other write statements in
       the summary tables of high ranked values, including removal 
       of '1X' used to skip the Fortran carriage-control character, 
       which is no longer needed.

  31.  Miscellaneous code clean-up, including the removal of
       extraneous Fortran 'SAVE' statements and specifying the
       SAVE attribute only where needed for local variable type
       declaration statements, removal of subroutines PRESOINC
       and PREREINC to eliminate unnecessary code redundancy,
       removal of unused subroutine EV_CHKDAT, removal of obsolete
       PRIME subroutine NUMMET, removal of unused PARAMETERS in
       MODULE MAIN1, replacement of DO loops for variable
       initialization with array assignments, improved consistency
       of error handling for processing of numeric inputs from
       the runstream file, adjusting header format in subroutine
       SHOUT for SEASONHR files with multiple output typse, and
       removal of code associated with "wet SCIM'ing" option
       which is not supported in AERMOD.  The input format for
       the SCIMBYHR keyword has also been adjusted to remove
       the parameters associated with wet SCIM'ing, but the
       model should still process input files based on the
       previous format while issuing a warning message.

This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: AERMOD (dated 09292).  Future changes to this model will be identified
by an updated Julian date found at the beginning of the model source code
and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n)
which will explain the nature and content of the changes.  All Model Change
Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference on
this website.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this program
will be made in the Recent Additions section of the SCRAM website.

              Addendum to Model Change Bulletin #3 for AERMOD

                    Description of OLMGROUP Keyword Bug

The Ozone Limiting Method (OLM) option was incorporated into the AERMOD
model with the version dated 04300.  One of the options available with the
non-DFAULT OLM option is the OLMGROUP keyword on the SO pathway, which allows
the user to specify which sources to combine for purposes of applying the OLM
option.  Section 2.4.5 of the AERMOD User's Guide Addendum describes the OLMGROUP
option.  Versions of AERMOD prior to version 09292 contain a serious coding error
in the implementation of the OLMGROUP option.  Due to a misplacement of array
initializations within subroutine OLM_CALC, the calculated concentrations for
sources included in any OLMGROUP may be erroneous for all receptors, except for
the first receptor.  The magnitude of the error will vary from one application
to another, and from one receptor to another.  However, the error is likely to
be significant in many cases, and the direction of the error is always biased
toward reducing the concentrations.  Any ongoing application of the AERMOD model
involving the use of the OLMGROUP keyword should be restarted with the updated
version of AERMOD dated 09292.  Recently completed analyses should also be
reexamined to determine the potential impact of the bug on the modeling results.
