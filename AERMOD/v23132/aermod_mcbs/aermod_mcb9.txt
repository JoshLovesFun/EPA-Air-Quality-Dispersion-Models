                        AERMOD (dated 13350)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERMOD
Dispersion Model. A brief description of the changes is provided
below.  Additional details are available in the Fortran source code.
Changes to the user instructions associated with this update are
documented in an updated AERMOD User's Guide Addendum.

This revised version of AERMOD (dated 13350) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (dated 12345):

--  Bug Fixes:

    1.  Modified subroutine HRQEXT to remove the FATAL = .TRUE. 
        statement for cases when the exit temp < 200K (about -100F) 
        with non-zero emissions in the HOUREMIS file.  This case was 
        intended to be treated as a non-fatal warning condition, but 
        was inadvertently treated as a fatal error in version 12345 
        by including the FATAL = .TRUE. statement. A fatal error 
        message is still generated if the hourly exit temperature is 
        less than 200K (about -100F) and the exit velocity is greater 
        than 200m/s, unless the hourly emissions are zero (0) for 
        that hour, since this would likely indicate that exit velocity
        and exit temperature were switched in the HOUREMIS file.

    2.  Modified subroutine HRLOOP to correct a bug associated with 
        use of the DAYRANGE keyword for multiple years of meteorological 
        data, where the YR/MN/DY conversion to Julian may be incorrect in
        relation to leap-years vs. non-leap-years. This problem was 
        partially corrected in version 12345.

    3.  Modified subroutine BGREAD to move the unit conversion for 
        hourly background concentrations to follow the READ statements 
        to avoid "double counting" unit conversion for non-hourly 
        background since unit conversion for BGFILL has already been
        applied in sub_BGVAL.

    4.  Moved calculation of the center of effective area source for 
        OPENPIT sources from subroutine ARDIST to subroutine PITEFF. 
        Previous versions would have skipped calculation of center 
        coordinates if the first receptor was located inside the 
        actual OPENPIT source.

    5.  Modified subroutine AREAIN to include an additional check 
        for the number of sides exceeding the maximum number for an 
        AREAPOLY source and to issue an AERMOD error message to avoid 
        a compiler-generated runtime error.

    6.  Modified subroutines wake_dfsn and wake_dfsn2 to correct a
        problem with virtual sigma-z values for the cavity source,
        which could result in anomalously high concentrations in
        some cases due to the initial dispersion coefficient for 
        the "cavity source" being set to zero (0).
        
    7.  Modified subroutine OLM_CALC to include a check for the 
        OLM value (variable OLMVAL) being zero (0) to avoid
        a zero-divide in calculating PercentNO2.

    8.  Modified subroutine HEFF to include plume rise for penetrated
        source, DHP3, for purposes of calculating plume height at 20km 
        for use in wet deposition/depletion calculations.
        
    9.  Modified subroutine IBLVAL to use a minimum value of 5m for 
        ZHI in the calculation of effective parameters.
        
   10.  Modified subroutine O3READ to avoid including a substituted 
        ozone (O3) value for hours with missing O3 data in the calculation 
        of the maximum ozone value within the past 24 hours, which may be
        used in the adjustment of the hourly O3 value under stable 
        conditions.


--  Enhancements:
 
    1.  Incorporated new options for modeling NO2, including a new 
        Default option for the Ambient Ratio Method (ARM) and a 
        non-Default BETA option for the Ambient Ratio Method - 2 
        (ARM2).
    
    2.  Incorporated options to vary background ozone (O3) data by 
        wind sector (new CO O3SECTOR keyword), and options to vary 
        background concentrations for the pollutant being modeled by 
        wind sector (new SO BGSECTOR keyword).  Any of the existing 
        options for specifying background data can be used with the
        new sector-varying options, and will continue to work as 
        before if no sectors are defined.  The applicable sector 
        is determined by the flow vector (downwind) based on the 
        wind direction in the surface meteorological data file.
        
    3.  Added new "debug" output file options for the OLM option
        and for the new ARM and ARM2 options for NO2. Also added
        a new PRIME debug option to separate the debug information
        associated with the PRIME downwash algorithm from the 
        non-PRIME related information provided under the MODEL
        debug option.  Also removed all debug information from
        the main 'aermod.out' file.


--  Miscellaneous:

    1.  Modified module MAIN1 and subroutine SRCSIZ to include a
        new NVPOLY parameter for the number of additional vertices 
        to include for AREAPOLY sources, beyond the number of 
        vertices used to define the source.  This is needed to 
        account for the integrated portion of the area intersecting 
        several sides of the polygon, depending on the geometry of 
        the source, receptor, and wind direction. The NVPOLY parameter 
        is assigned a value of 12, which should work in most cases, 
        but users are cautioned to avoid overly complex shapes for 
        AREAPOLY sources to avoid model runtime errors. Reducing the 
        complexity of AREAPOLY sources will also reduce model runtime 
        in most cases. The value of NVPOLY is added to NVMAX (determined 
        based on the maximum number of area sources vertices defined 
        by the user) in subroutine SRCSIZ for purposes of allocating 
        arrays for AREAPOLY sources. The previous version of AERMOD 
        added a value of 8 to NVMAX in subroutine SRCSIZ.
        
    2.  Incorporated checks on the consistency of concentrations that
        are calculated during the EVENT processing mode with the original
        value calculated during normal processing, which is included on 
        the EVENTPER keyword. Warning messages are generated if the 
        results are inconsistent, which may indicate a potential error
        in the AERMOD code. Subroutine EVPER was also modified to make
        the concentration field (provided by AERMOD during the initial 
        non-EVENT processing) mandatory.

    3.  Modified several subroutines to include the AERMET version date
        associated with the input meteorological data in the header records
        of the 'aermod.out' file and all other output file options. Also
        modified the earliest acceptable version date for AERMET inputs
        from 11059 to 12345. However, users are encouraged to use input
        meteorological data based on the latest version of the AERMET 
        processor (dated 13350).
        
    4.  Modified subroutines MEREAD, MEOPEN, and METEXT to extract met
        data station IDs from the header record of the surface met data
        file based on the index of keywords within the header record 
        to provide more flexibility in the positioning of station IDs 
        within the surface header record.

    5.  Modified some error/warning messages to improve the clarity of the
        message and to provide more flexibility in the error reporting.
        For example:
        
        a. Errors associated with allocating arrays have been modified 
           to identify the type of array(s) being allocated when the
           error occurs;
        
        b. Additional error handling and reporting has been incorporated 
           for problems associated with opening, reading, and/or writing 
           to external data files;
        
        c. Subroutine JULIAN was modified to provide additional information 
           when errors occur to facilitate diagnosing and correcting problems;
        
        d. Subroutines ERRHDL, TERRST, and other subroutines that call these
           routines, were modified to include up to 12 characters in the module 
           names included in error/warning/informational messages. The previous 
           version limited the module name to 6 characters.

This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: AERMOD (dated 13350).  Future changes to this model will be identified
by an updated Julian date found at the beginning of the model source code
and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n)
which will explain the nature and content of the changes.  All Model Change
Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference on
this website.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this program
will be made in the Recent Additions section of the SCRAM website.
