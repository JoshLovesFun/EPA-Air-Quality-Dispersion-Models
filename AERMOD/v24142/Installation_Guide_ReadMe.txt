Installation Guide - Read Me First

System Requirements:

	Any modern PC that meets the recommended, not minimum, 
	RAM memory and CPU requirements of the respective 
	Operating System should be adequate enough to run the 
	AERMOD modeling system. Any computer system recently 
	built as a "work station" should have more than enough 
	RAM memory, CPU processing power, and hard drive space 
	to run AERMOD.

  If your system meets these requirements, please proceed by
  reading through the Sample Run Instructions. This document
  will provide steps to download and set up the AERMOD modeling 
  system and guide the user through their first sample run.

  After working through the Sample Run Instructions, the user can choose 
  if they would like to download and use AERPLOT, a post-processor to
  AERMOD that is used to visualize AERMOD output in Google Earth.
