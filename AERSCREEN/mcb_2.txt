                        AERSCREEN (dated 11076)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERSCREEN 
screening model.  A brief description of the changes is provided below. 
Additional details are available in the FORTRAN source code and in 
the AERSCREEN user's guide.


This revised version of AERSCREEN (dated 11076) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (11060):

Bug Fixes

1.  Modified subroutine MAKETERRAIN to change the variable xdist
    to always be 1.1 times the probe distance for the DOMAINXY
    keyword that goes into AERMAP.  In version 11060, for the
    FLOWSECTOR stage of AERSCREEN, xdist was set to 1.1 times the
    probe distance while in FLOWSECTOR it is set to
    1.1 times the final distance.  In complex terrain, this change
    in DOMAINXY can affect hill height scales, affecting concentrations.
