                           AERSURFACE Version 20060
                       (version date February 29, 2020)

       This version of AERSURFACE is an update to 19039_DRFT and replaces  
       version 13016 and 19039_DRFT. It includes enhancements to support   
       processing of1992/2001/2006/2011/2016 Land Cover data, including  
       percent impervious and percent tree canopy data (where available) to  
       supplement concurrent land cover data.
       
       This version includes both the the ZORAD and ZOEFF options for 
       determining roughness. ZORAD is equivalent to the method 
       used in AERSURFACE version 13016 and is recommended for regulatory 
       applications. The ZOEFF option was introduced in version 19039_DRFT
       as a research grade option and is the equivalent of an alpha 
       option, meant only for review and is not intended for  
       regulatory applications at this time. 

=======================================================================

       This version of AERSURFACE includes the following modifications 
       relative to the previous versions dated 13016 and 19039_DRFT:
            
-----  Enhancements:

       1.  Path/Keyword interface similar to AERMOD, AERMET, and AERMAP. 
           NOTE: This version is not compatible with the redirected input 
           from files generated with previous versions AERSURFACE.
           
       2.  Option to output surface values with appropriate AERMET
           keywords for the PRIMARY or SECONDARY meteorological tower
           location. (Default is PRIMARY.)
           
       3.  Option to separately characterize individual wind sectors as  
           either airport or non-airport for determining surface roughness
           length. Previous versions required all wind sectors to 
           be characterized as either airport or non-airport.
 
       4.  Option (ZOEFF) to compute surface roughness length based on the 
           Effective Roughness Model Coding Abstract (MCA) included in the
           User's Guide in which n effective roughness is derived using an 
           Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) method to estimate the appropriate 
           fetch from the meteorological tower location based on the wind 
           measurement height and local land cover characteristics. 
           Default option (ZORAD) uses a fixed radial distance from the 
           tower (e.g., 1 km) as in previous versions of AERSURFACE.

       5.  Option to supplement land cover data with percent impervious 
           and percent canopy data to derive surface roughness length. 
           Percent impervious and percent tree canopy data are supplied  
           as part of the National Land Cover Dataset and are only 
           applicable to post-1992 NLCD years.

-----  Miscellaneous:

       1.  A valid range on the allowable height of the anemometer
           representing surface wind measurements has been imposed. 
           The valid range is 1.0 - 100.0 meters.

       2.  This version of AERSURFACE assumes all NLCD data, including
           land cover, percent impervious, and percent canopy are
           provided in GeoTIFF format without the use of compression.
           The 1992 NLCD "state binary files" once provided by the USGS that 
           AERSURFACE was originally developedto process cannot be processed 
           with this version. 

       3.  Modified to account for non-standard pixel spacing in the
           NLCD products. Previous versions assumed an exact reported
           pixel size of 30.0 meters. The pixel spacing in more
           recent data may not be reported in the GeoTIFF file as 
           exactly 30.0 meters. 

       4.  Miscellaneous updates to remove comments, obsolete code,
           and corrections to warning and informational messages.
