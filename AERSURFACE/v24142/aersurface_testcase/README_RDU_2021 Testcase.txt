This is an example for demonstration purposes only using the Raleigh Durham International Airport as the site location and the NLCD 2021 data products including land cover supplemented with percent impervious, and percent tree canopy data. Some of the inputs, such as climate, snow cover, and month-to-season assignments were not evaluated for an application and were specified only to demonstrate the AERSURFACE input features.
