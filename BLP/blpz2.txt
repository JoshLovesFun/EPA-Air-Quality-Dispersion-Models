                             BLP (dated 90081)

      BLP is an acronym for an air dispersion model that consists of three
programs, BLP, BLPSUM, and POSTBLP. The following changes are grouped by
program. The first set of changes are for BLP followed in succession by
POSTBLP and then BLPSUM changes.

BLP Changes

     In subroutine Cubic of BLP, a bug was detected and fixed, and the arc
cosine function name ARCOS was changed to the more standard ACOS name.
Otherwise the main body of the source code remains unchanged for both BLP and
its post-processor, POSTBLP. The program headers and the title write and
comment statements of both programs have been modified to reflect the fix in
BLP and to indicate that these two programs are SCRAM BBS versions. 

     For the sake of brevity and clarity, the length of the sequence
identifiers in the following list of changes for BLP have been shortened by
deleting the BL of BLP, or XX of XXX in each case. This reduces the confusion
caused by 80 column lines wrapping around to the next line and appearing as if
the end of each of the previous lines is the beginning of the next line. Each
of the two deleted characters should be reinserted in their appropriate place
in columns 72 and 73.

     The following is a list of changes made to BLP:


1.  Whenever the source code is changed, the SCRAM BBS header is also changed.
    The following two lines in the header were changed from: 
 
C                          BLP (DATED 82102)                            P00010
C             *** SEE BLP MODEL CHANGE BULLETIN MCB#1 ***               P00061
 
to:

C             *** SEE BLP MODEL CHANGE BULLETIN MCB#2 ***               P00061

2.  Various statements used in writing BLP titles and version numbers to a
    printout have also been modified. The following non consecutive lines have
    been changed or commented out:

6.  In the following lines of code, the intrinsic function name, ARCOS, was
    changed from:

      ALPHA=ARCOS(BP/(AP3*CM))/3.                                       P17710

POSTBLP Changes


     The old header in POSTBLP was changed to a SCRAM BBS type header and an
old version title line, PBP00120 (P00120) was deleted. Also various statements
used in writing POSTBLP titles and version numbers to a printout have also
been modified. Note that the first two characters, PB, of each sequence
identifier have been dropped due to the 80 column wrap around problem
discussed above. These two charaters need to be reinserted once the files have
been downloaded and dearchived. 


1.  The old header was changed from:

2.  The next 44 non consecutive lines of code were used to print POSTBLP
    titles and version numbers. The lines of code have been either commented
    out or modified so that only a SCRAM BBS program date is printed. In
    several cases, comments were deleted. The original lines of code were
    changed from:

BLPSUM Changes

     The third program, BLPSUM, in the BLP model was updated with a SCRAM BBS
header and comments. In some cases, comments were deleted but the lines were
left. Two variables used for identifying and printing the version and level
number were commented out. The following non consecutive lines were changed
from:

Again, notice that the sequence identifiers were shortened to save space. The
identifiers for BLPSUM need to have a BP added in columns 72 and 73 when the
program is stored.

     Several changes have been made to the BLP readme file and other files to:

        1)  Provide the user with information on BLPSUM input file structure,
        variable definitions, and execution lines.

        2)  Correct and revamp the batch files

        3)  Add a test case for using binary meteorological data with BLP

        4)  Change the archival compression method from .ARC to .ZIP

        5)  Provide definitions for variables not listed in the July 1980
        BLP user's guide.

        6)  Generally edit and shorten the README file.


     See the BLP.RME file in the archival package, BLP.ZIP, for details on
running BLP.
