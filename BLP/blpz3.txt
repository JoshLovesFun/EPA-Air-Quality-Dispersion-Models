    This Model Change Bulletin documents changes made to the Bouyant Line and 
Point (BLP) Source dispersion model (see Code Changes below).   The BLP model
consists of three programs: BLP, BLPSUM, and POSTBLP.

    The BLP User's Guide and Addendum were scanned to a TIF format, converted 
to an Adobe Acrobat 3.0 format, and then posted to SCRAM.


CODE CHANGES

    Changes from BLP (dated 90081) include the following:

1.  BLP was changed to read ISCST type meteorological data in ASCII format.  
    Conversion of meteorological data to a binary format is no longer needed
    and is no longer supported in the model.

2.  A command line interface was added to the programs so that Input and Output
    filenames could be read from a MS-DOS prompt without having to use the "<" 
    and ">" file redirection symbols.  See the BLP.RME file for further 
    details.

3.  Comments annotating the changes to the source codes were added.

    This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: BLP (dated 99176).  Future changes to this model will be identified
by an updated Julian date found at the beginning of the model source code
and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n)
which will explain the nature and content of the changes.  All Model Change
Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference on
this website.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this program
will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this website.
