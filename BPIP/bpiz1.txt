                     Model Change Bulletin              
              
                            MCB#1                      01/19/94

                    BPIP (dated 93320)



     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the
activities of the SCRAM BBS for this model.

     BPIP (Building Profile Input Program) is designed to calculate
building heights and projected building widths based on an
implementation of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height and
building downwash guidance.  The output data from BPIP has to be
manually edited into the appropriate ISC2 input runstream.

     This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a
Julian date, i.e.: BPIP (dated 93320). Future changes to this
program will be identified by an updated Julian date found on the
first line of the model source code and followed by a reference
to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n.txt) which will explain
the nature and contents of the changes. All Model Change
Bulletins for this model will always be available for back
reference on this BBS. In the future, notification of changes
(MCBs) to this model will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section
of this BBS immediately following the LOGON procedure.

      The source code for this model has been compiled and tested
on an IBM PC computer.  A math coprocessor is required.

                       ******************
   
      New Model Change Bulletins will ONLY be issued when there
is a change to the source code for this model. Changes to test
cases and/or any pre and post processors that are included in the
archived file for this model will be addressed and appropriately
identified in an amendment to the model's latest MCB with
notification posted in the SCRAM ALERTS section of the BBS.
