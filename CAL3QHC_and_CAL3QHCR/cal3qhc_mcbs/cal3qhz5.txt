                            CAL3QHC  (Dated 95221)
                            CAL3QHCR (Dated 04174)

     Both CAL3QHC and CAL3QHCR are covered by this Model Change Bulletin (MCB)
under the CAL3QHC model name.  Since CAL3QHCR is an enhanced but separate
version of CAL3QHC, both models will retain their respective Julian creation
dates.  Under this MCB, both models, only CAL3QHCR has been updated and only
CAL3QHCR has a new creation date.

     The one of the dimensions of the array variables used in creating the
Calm Duration Table was set too low for certain meteorological data sets that
have a large number of 1-hour in duration calms.  The array value has been 
reset from 200 to 2000.  The overflow from these variables caused some of the
values in the table to appear with astericks in the day of occurrence field
and it caused erroneous totals for some of the concentrations. 

     Additional modifications to the model includes additional write 
statements, and an additional output file to capture DOS window output.  The 
execution statement has been modified as appears below in the change comments.

Modification comments have been added to the model.  They are:

C                       June 23, 2004 - An array upper bound overflow condition 
C                                       is possible when the number of calms in

C                                       200.  The related array sizes were   
C                                       increased.  Also, when the mixing 
C                                       heights are both zero, the program 
C                                       crashes.  A substitute value is now 
C                                       used and a warning message to check the

A variable for file names was added so that the input file names could be read from
a control file.  This would add the ability to enter long file names in a text file 
instead of creating a BAT (batch file) with long filenames which can be troublesome.
