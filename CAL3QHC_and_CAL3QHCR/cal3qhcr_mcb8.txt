                        CAL3QHCR (dated 13196)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the CAL3QHCR
Dispersion Model. A brief description of the changes is provided below.
Additional details are available in the Fortran source code.

This revised version of CAL3QHCR (dated 13196) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (dated 12355):

--  Bug Fixes:

----  1.      Dates and times in the .OUT files were output with values
              of zero after page two. The correct dates and times are 
              now displayed on all pages. 

----  2.      Two variables, an integer loop limit and a floating point 
              ratio, were given the same name, 'LIM'. The name of the 
              ratio has been changed to 'LIMRAT' to eliminate the 
              duplication. 


--  Enhancements:

----  1.      A new output file is added which contains the 
              maximum design concentrations for all receptors. For PM, 
              this is based on 24-hr averages and for CO, this is based 
              on a rolling 8-hr average. The file is formatted to match 
              other EPA model output and is designed to facilitate 
              plotting the model data. See the description of the 
              PLOTFILE in section 3.7 of the AERMOD User Guide 
              (EPA-454/B-03-001, under revision) for more details on the 
              format of this new output file. 

----  2.      The .CTL file passed to CAL3QHCR has been expanded by one 
              line to accommodate specifying the name of the new output 
              file. The new file name is now a necessary input parameter 
              in the .CTL file and an error message will be displayed 
              if the file name is not specified. The format for the .CTL 
              is now:

              [full pathname] Message filename
              [full pathname] input filename
              [full pathname] meteorological filename
              [full pathname] ET1 filename
              [full pathname] ET2 filename
              [full pathname] Output filename
              [full pathname] Link data filename
              [full pathname] Plot file name


--  Miscellaneous:

----  1.      The control files in the test suite (i.e., C1C.CTL,
              R1C.CTL, R2C.CTL, R1P.CTL, R2P.CTL, and MED.CTL) have
              been updated with the new line.

----  2.      The output of date time strings now includes the leading
              zeros. For example, ' 1/ 1/ 9   1: 1: 1' will now be 
              printed as '01/01/09  01:01:01'. 

----  3.      The subroutine used to obtain the system date and time
              has been updated to comply with current F90 standards, 
              changed from 'GETDAT' to 'DATE_AND_TIME'.

This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: CAL3QHCR (dated 13196).  All Model Change Bulletins for this program 
will always be available for back reference on this website.  Future 
notification of changes (MCBs) to any programs will be made in the Recent 
Additions section of the SCRAM website.
