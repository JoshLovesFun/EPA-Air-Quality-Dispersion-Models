This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the CAL3QHCR
Dispersion Model. A brief description of the changes is provided
below.  Additional details are available in the Fortran source code.


This revised version of CAL3QHCR (dated 12355) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (dated 04244):

--  Bug Fixes:

		1.	No bug fixes were made at this time. 


--  Enhancements:

		1.	The number of sources allowed in the model was increased 
			from 120 to 5000 and the number of receptors was increased 
			from 60 to 5000. 

		2.	The accuracy of internal model calculations was improved and 
			mixed-mode calculations were eliminated such that all integer
			variables used in calculations with floating point values were 
			converted to floating point variables. 

		3.	The sixth highest concentration value was added to the list of
			output values. 

--  Miscellaneous:

		1.	The date and time functions used to determine model execution 
			time were updated with current standard supported functions. 

		2.	The number of significant figures in the output was increased 
			to 4 decimal places.

This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: CAL3QHCR (dated 12355).  All Model Change Bulletins for this program 
will always be available for back reference on this website.  Future 
notification of changes (MCBs) to any programs will be made in the Recent 
Additions section of the SCRAM website.
