                            CAL3QHC  (Dated 04244)
                            CAL3QHCR (Dated 04244)

     Both CAL3QHC and CAL3QHCR are covered by this Model Change Bulletin (MCB)
under the CAL3QHC model name.  Since CAL3QHCR is an enhanced but separate
version of CAL3QHC, both models will retain their respective Julian creation
dates.  Under this MCB, both models, have been updated and therefore both
models have a new creation date.

     Both models have been recompiled using Compaq Visual Fortran V6.6c.  This
should eliminate some memory management problems that were occurring on 
Windows XP based systems when using executables that were compiles using 
Microsoft Fortran and other 16-bit compilers.

The following are detailed changes made to both models

CAL3QHC

Only a few informational sections were modified:

The model's SCRAM header was changed from:

CAL3QHCR

     A bug was reported and fixed where CAL3QHCR was erroneously terminating
when reading Year 2000 meteorological data.

The main program header was updated.

A brief comment was added describing the changes made to the model.

C                       September 1, 2004 - A bug that prevented Year 2000

This code corrects ends the erroneously terminating bug mentioned above.

from:

          IF (MYR .LT. 1 .OR. MYR .GT. 99) MFLG(1) = 1

to:

          IF (MYR .LT. 0 .OR. MYR .GT. 99) MFLG(1) = 1



The creation date was updated.

from:

 200  FORMAT (A1,58X,'CAL3QHCR (Dated: 04181)')

to:

 200  FORMAT (A1,58X,'CAL3QHCR (Dated: 04244)')


from:

 300  FORMAT (A1,46X,'CAL3QHCR (Dated: 04181)')

to:

 300  FORMAT (A1,46X,'CAL3QHCR (Dated: 04244)')


The PM format was expanded to the hundreths decimal place.
This was done to accomodate some sensitivity testing and left
in place.


from:

  164 FORMAT (1X, I4, 2F8.1)

to:
