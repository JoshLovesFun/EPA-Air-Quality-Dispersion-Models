****  A hard copy of this file (for downloading purposes) is suggested.  ****


     All files with a "ZIP" extention name must then be unzipped (dearchived)
using the unzip program available for downloading from the System Utilities
menu of the TTN.  The unzip program "PKUNZIP.EXE" must also be stored in the
same DOS directory with the tutorial ZIP files.  Simply type PKUNZIP followed
by a space and the name of the ZIP file and the files included in the ZIP will
be generaged in your DOS directory.  After dearchiving all of the above files,
type CTSCRND to invoke the CTSCREEN demonstration.

     Files with the "WPF" extention name are in WordPerfect format and must
be imported into your WordPerfect word processor.  The original documentation
was formatted for an HP LaserJet II series printer.  The pagination of your
printed file may differ due to variations in printer and font types.
