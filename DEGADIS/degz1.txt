                     Model Change Bulletin

                   DEGADIS 2.1 (dated 90012)



     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the 
activities of the SCRAM BBS for the DEGADIS 2.1 model, a new model
and associated user's guide which completely replace the dense gas
dispersion model DEGADIS 2.0.  DEGADIS 2.0 will no longer be
supported on the SCRAM system.  Future revisions to DEGADIS 2.1
will remain identified by the name DEGADIS 2.1, and the revisions
will be outlined in a model change bulletin.
 
      The DEGADIS 2.1 model code available from this bulletin board
is a FORTRAN source code intended for compilation and execution on
a VAX computer operating VMS.  This code is not intended for use
on an IBM PC or clone.  A PC version is currently under development
and will be provided through this bulletin board when it is
cleared for public access.

     After the source code programs have been dearchived, the file
AAREADME.TXT should be consulted for information concerning the
compilation of that code on a VAX machine.  Included with the
source code are two example input files (EX1.IN and EX2.IN) and
their associated output files (EX1.OPT and EX2.OPT), which may be
used to test the code after compilation.

     This model will henceforth be identified by its name and a 
julian date, i.e.: DEGADIS 2.1 (90012). Future changes to this 
model will be identified by an updated julian date found on the 
first line of the model source code and followed by a reference 
to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n) which will explain 
the nature and contents of the changes. All Model Change 
Bulletins for this model will always be available for back 
reference on this BBS. In the future, notification of changes 
(MCBs) to this model will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section 
of this BBS immediately following the LOGON procedure. 
 
      The source code for this model has been compiled and tested
on a VAX 8650 computer.  Watch SCRAM ALERTS for notification 
of new MCBs about DEGADIS 2.1.  

      The new user's guide to DEGADIS 2.1 ( titled "User's Guide
for the DEGADIS 2.1 Dense Gas Dispersion Model) is being made
available through the National Technical Information Service
(NTIS).  As soon as it is assigned an accession number by NTIS,
that information will be made available in an addendum to this
bulletin.

                       ****************** 
    
      New Model Change Bulletins will ONLY be issued when there 
is a change to the source code for this model. Changes to test 
cases and/or any pre and post processors that are included in the
archived file for this model will be addressed and appropriately
identified in an amendment to the model's latest MCB with 
notification posted in the SCRAM ALERTS section of the BBS.
