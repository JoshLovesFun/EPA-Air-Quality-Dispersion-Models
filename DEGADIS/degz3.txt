                   DEGADIS 2.1 (dated 90180)



     This Model Change Bulletin announces corrections in the
source code for the subprograms TUPF.FOR, TPROP.FOR,
DEGBRIDGE.FOR, and LIMIT.FOR in DEGADIS 2.1.  The corrections in
TIPF.FOR allow for a more robust treatment of large releases
under low wind speed conditions.  The corrections in TPROP.FOR
allow for a more consistent treatment of the variables "tmin0",
"tmax0", and "iwtfl".  The corrections in DEGBRIDGE.FOR effect a
consistent treatment of the cloud thermodynamic properties in the
JETPLU portion of the model and the DEGADIS portion of the model.

     The corrections have been made possible through observations
made by the users of this SCRAM bulletin board system.  If you
have additional questions or comments about the DEGADIS 2.1
model, please leave a message on the bulletin board for Dave
Guinnup.
