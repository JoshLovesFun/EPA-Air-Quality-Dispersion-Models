                   DEGADIS 2.1 (dated 90257)



     This Model Change Bulletin announces corrections in the
source code for the subprograms JETPLU_IN.FOR and RKGST.FOR in
DEGADIS 2.1.  The corrections (1) allow for the input of a user-
specified Monin-Obukhov length through the jet/plume initiation
of the model, and (2) correct an error which would cause the
integration method to incorrectly appear to fail.  Only these two
subprograms have been changed.

     In the subprogram JETPLU_IN.FOR, the ".or." in line 214 has
been changed to ".and." as follows:

       if( indvel.ne.1 .and. indvel.ne.2) indvel = 1

     In the subprogram RKGST.FOR, lines 381 to the end have been
changed as follows:

       GOTO 389
 370   IHLF=12
       GOTO 389
 380   IHLF=13
 389   CALL FCT(X,Y,DERY,PRMT)
       CALL OUTP(X,Y,DERY,IHLF,NDIM,PRMT)
       RETURN
 390   CALL FCT(X,Y,DERY,PRMT)
       CALL OUTP(X,Y,DERY,IHLF,NDIM,PRMT)
 400   IHLF=0
       RETURN
       END

     Numerical results from the model execution remain unchanged
by these corrections.
