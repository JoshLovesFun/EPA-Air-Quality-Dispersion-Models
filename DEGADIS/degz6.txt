                   DEGADIS 2.1 (dated 91056)


     This Model Change Bulletin is to announce some minor changes
to the DEGADIS 2.1 model.  These changes are as follows:

     1)  The air density calculation has been standardized
between subroutines DEG4S.FOR, DEBRIDG.VAX/MPC, DEGINP.FOR,
IO.FOR, JETINT.FOR, JETPLU.FOR, JETPLUIN.FOR, PFILE.FOR, and
TPROP.FOR.

     2)  Command files generated by DEGINP in the VAX version
previously used wrong filenames.  This has been corrected.

     3)  DEG4 has been corrected to allow the reporting of concen-
tration vs time histories for locations above the centerline
(i.e., where y=0). This changed some coding in the subroutine
DOSOUT.FOR

     In addition, it has been noted by several users that the
program will not compile on a PC using Microsoft FORTRAN versions
prior to version 5.0.  Please note that version 5.0 or better is
required for compilation.

     The README.DOC file has been altered to include the above
information.

     The source code and PC executables are now offered in separate
archives for downloading.  The source code is in one archive and the
executables are available in 4 separate archives for those who cannot
compile the source programs.

     Watch SCRAM ALERTS for notification of new MCBs about DEGADIS
2.1.

may be referred to Dave Guinnup at (919) 541-5368 or FTS 629-5368.
