                   DEGADIS 2.1 (dated 92260)



     This Model Change Bulletin is to announce some minor changes
to the DEGADIS 2.1 model.  These changes are as follows:

     1)  The subroutine PSS.FOR has been modified to correct the
apparent failure of some valid transient simulations.

     2)  The output for transient jet/plume cases has been
corrected to list the appropriate downwind distances.

     3)  A correction has been made to enable simulations with
initial mass of diluted contaminant over the source.

     4)  Some clarifications have been made to the output.

     5)  The input method for diluted sources was clarified to
reduce the potential for user input error.

     The README.DOC file has been altered to include the above
information.

2.1.
