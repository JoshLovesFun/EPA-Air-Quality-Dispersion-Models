                       DEGADIS 2.1 (dated 12260)


This Model Change Bulletin is to announce some minor changes
to the DEGADIS 2.1 model.  The changes implemented through this MCB here 
did not change the model computations in any way.  These changes are 
as follows:

     1)  Update of the operating system calls to be compatible with the
         Intel Visual Fortran Compiler XE.

     2)  Development of files to compile and link the code using the
         standard utility NMAKE.
     
     3)  Elimination of computer system calls through the source code.
     
     4)  Elimination of the use of the Interface statement and C programming
         language based code.
         
     5)  Improved file handling to eliminate file-not-found errors.    
     
     6)  Revision of the batch files for running the jet/plume model 
         to avoid file-not-found messages for some cases.
         
     7)  Enhancements to the Batch test case files.    

Problems, questions, or comments concerning DEGADIS 2.1 should be sent
through our SCRAM website "Contact Us" link or to the original developer, 
Dr. Tom Spicer, University of Arkansas (tos@uark.edu).

Special thanks to Thomas Baker for his checking over the DEGADIS package 
and for his very good suggestions.
