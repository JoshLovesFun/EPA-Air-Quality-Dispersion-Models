                   MIXING HEIGHT PROGRAM (dated 98340)



     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the activities of the
SCRAM Web site for this program.

      The Mixing Height program code available from this web site is a PC
compatible version for use of processing meteorological data for refined
dispersion models, such as ISCST3.  This program utilizes the CD-ROM
meteorological data from NCDC to compute mixing heights.  See the README.TXT
in the MIXHTS file for information on ordering data from the National
Climatic Data Center.
  
      This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian
date, i.e.: Mixing Height (dated 98340). Future changes to this program will
be identified by an updated julian date found on the first line of the model
source code and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin
(MCB#n) which will explain the nature and contents of the changes. All Model
Change Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference
on this BBS. In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this model will
be made in the WHAT'S NEW section of this web site found under the SCRAM
CONTENTS heading.
