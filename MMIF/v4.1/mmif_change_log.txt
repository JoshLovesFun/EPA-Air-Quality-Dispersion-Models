Date        Details/changes
----------  ----------------
2009-05-26  Original Development: EPA R7, ENVIRON International Corp.
            Initially only output CALPUFF format (mimic CALMET).
2011-08-01  (FWS) Support for 50-cat NLCD data used in EPA 2008 WRF.
2011-09-30  MMIFv2.0 released.

2011-09-30  ENVIRON Added output for several other models, lat-lon/LCC
            subsetting, etc.  Required a major re-write and 
            generalization of the core code.  A placeholder for vertical
            interpolaction to fixed levels is included.
2011-09-30  New in v2.0: command_line().
2011-09-30  Moved aggregation code from mmif.f90 to aggregate.f90.
2011-09-30  New in v2.0: cloud_cover() code taken from program mm5aermod.
2011-09-30  New in v2.0: sample_input() to have "mmif --sample" create a
            sample control (*.inp) file.
2011-09-30  New in v2.0: functions.f90, mostly thermodyanic functions developed
            by Bart Brashers over the years.
2011-09-30  New in v2.1: interpolate() as an alternative to aggregate().
2011-09-30  Bug fix: in landuse.f90, albedo for water (cat. 16) was 0.8, should 
            be 0.08.
2011-09-30  Major re-write of met_fields.f90 to support more output formats.
2011-09-30  Added calmet_terrain() routine.
2011-09-30  Added code in read_mm5() and read_wrf() to look for z0,
            albedo, MOL, LAI, etc. in MM5/WRF file.  Support for other 
            projections than LCC, and sub-set by Lat-Lon & km, etc.
2011-09-30  In pblmet.f90, handle case when Monin-Obukhov length L not
            found in MM5/WRF file.
2011-11-15  Print MM5/WRF sigma levels with heights in read_mm5(),
            even for CALPUFF. 
2011-12-12  Minor fix: clear up confusion between central and std lat/lon.
2011-12-12  Clear up confusion between central and std lat/lon in projections.
2012-01-17  Moved zface2 and avg_zface to their respective routines, out of
            met_fields.f90.
2012-01-31  Added support for WRF's 50-category NLCD land-use method.
            Removed user control of ZiMin, ZiMax.  Set to "sane" values.
2012-01-31  Moved definition of zmid to earlier in the flow of aggregate().
2012-01-31  Moved code for vertmap() to aggregate.f90, eliminated vertmap.f90.
2012-01-31  avg_zface.f90 moved from the top of aggregate.f90.
2012-01-31  Added --debug flag to command_line(), updated sample control file.
2012-01-31  New subroutine names (landuse_usgs and landuse_nlcd) and remove
            unused vars.
2012-01-31  Made sure aggregation parts (moving/adding levels) in
            output_calmet() gets skipped if ZFACE(1) is 20m, either by
            chance or if using interpolation.
            Many more small changes, some cosmetic or helpful.
2012-01-31  Bug fix: in calmet_hour(), pOut(,,1) was interpolated
            between 0 and pOut(,,2). 
            Changed 2D fields DENSITY and RH in calmet_hour() to use
            2m values, like CALMET would if using observational data.
            To avoid the dependence on T10 (calculated) in
            calmet_hour(), we instead set the new 0-20m T to be
            interpolated between known T2 and T(1).  This was fixed
            later, when a more accurate version of the PBL routines
            was developed.  CALPUFF isn't very sensitive to T anyway,
            and I suspect that aggregation will become unpopular -- I
            believe interpolation will prove to be more accurate that
            aggregation. 
2012-01-31  Write out the final zmid values to screen in
            onsite_header(), like in calmet_header(). 
2012-01-31  Bug fix: scichem_terrain() was writing the whole grid, not
            just sub-grid.  Note: this routine not currently used,
            retained in case it's useful in the future.
2012-01-31  Renamed subroutine pgstb() to pg_srdt() to be more
            consistent.  Changed delt from t10-t0 to tt(i,j,1)-t2, to
            follow guidance, and remove dependence on t10 (a
            calculated variables).  It is only used at night, and then
            only the sign is used, so we don't need to be too precise
            about it. 
2012-01-31  New routine pg_golder(), following CTDMplus's LSTAB
            routine, which is also used by CALPUFF.
2012-01-31  Tested and discarded routine ltopg() after it didn't match
            either Fig 4 or 5 in the 1972 paper.
2012-01-31  Moved PBL height calculation from pblmet() to pbl_height()
            to make it more general.  Also created pbl_limits() to set
            limits on PBL Height required by downstream dispersion
            models. 
2012-01-31  New routines sfc_layer() and stratify(), following
            MCIPv3.6 pblsup.f90 procedure, to replace pblmet().  
2012-01-31  MMIFv2.1 released.

2012-02-21  Bug fix: wind direction changed to MET convention (0 deg is N)
            for AERMOD modes.  Resulted in MMIFv2.1 patch 1.
2012-02-21  uv2sd() now supports wind direction in MET convention (0 deg is 
            North) to support AERMOD-like output.
2012-02-21  MMIFv2.1p1  released.

2012-03-07  Bug fix: CALPUFFv6 time-stamps were off by 1 hour.
            Simplified the calculation of irlg, ndathr, and jday.
2012-03-07  Clarified the 6.x output beginning time-stamp to be more
            consistent with CALMET v5.8 output.  
2012-03-07  Minor fix: use new ymdh2nDatHr routine in read_mm5(),
            eliminating jday.
2012-03-07  Added ymdh2nDatHr to timesubs.f90, increased usage of
            Leap_yr() routine to be more efficient. 
2012-03-13  Bug fix: in read_wrf(), XTIME and saving of precip were
            wrong for the first WRFOUT file from a WRF initialization.
2012-03-16  Calculate q2 too in sfc_layer() if it's missing.
2012-03-16  Testing of the new sfc_layer() routine shows that its T10 
            calculation is better than the old pblmet() routine.  The
            workaround for reliance on a calcuated T10 (see 2012-01-31
            above) can now be reversed.
2012-08-23  MMIFv2.2 released.

2012-09-04  Bug fix: some compilations of netCDF don't blank text strings
            passed to nf_get_att_text().  We'll blank them before passing.
2012-09-04  Added more logic to detect un-supported LANDUSE versions,
            when z0,Albedo, and/or LAI were _not_ included in the MET data.
2012-10-01  Removed ZiMin,ZiMax from call to scichem_useful().
2012-10-01  Bug fix: ZiMin and ZiMax always -999 in scichem_useful().
            Fix that. 
2013-01-17  Moved allocation of zavg from met_fields.f90 to avg_zface().
2013-01-22  Aggregation no longer supported for SCICHEM output.
            Added sanity check for SCICHEM output: zmid(nzOut) > max(topo).
2013-01-22  Bug fix: interpolate to _transformed_ layers for SCICHEM, after
            Corresponding with the SCICHEM authors.  
2013-01-22  In scichem_useful(), removed ZB, changed ZMAX from
            zface(nzOut) to zmid(nzOut), following feedback from model
            authors. 
2013-01-22  Force vertical velocity at H = zmid(nzOut) to be zero in
            medoc_hour().  Also see changes in interpolate.f90, for a
            bug fix related to the vertical grid structure in SCICHEM.
2013-01-25  Bug fix: cloud_cover() output was in tens, wanted a fraction.
2013-01-25  New in v2.3: cloud cover algorithm cloud_cover_COAMS() following 
            Angevine (2012).  cloud_cover() renamed cloud_cover_mm5aermod(),
            no longer called by anything, but retained in the code.
2013-01-25  Added routine scichem_sampler() to create SAM file,
            containing the centers of each grid cell in the modeling
            domain. 
2013-02-25  Lengthened file/path strings from 120 to 256 characters, based
            on user feedback.
2013-03-05  Changed sanity check for AERCOARE output: print a warning for hours
            that are not over water (i.e. over ice).
2013-03-05  Added --version switch to command_line().
2013-03-05  Set iswater(:,:) every time step - it changes with time due 
            to changing sea ice in WRF files.
2013-03-18  Added tsky = cloud cover to output for AERCOARE, just so it
            appears in the eventual SFC file (used only for deposition).
2013-03-18  Bug fix: surface level report in upperair_hour() was in
            kts, now in 10th of a m/s. 
2013-04-30  MMIFv2.3 released.

2013-05-01  Reduce number of AERMOD warnings for stable conditions.
2013-05-01  Implement minimum AERMOD wind speed, following AERMET v12345.
2013-05-02  Tidied up the declarations in mmif.f90, with better comments.

2013-05-02  Moved sanity check for CALMET and WRF using same projection from
            read_wrf.f90 to mmif.f90, to facilitate moving outform
	    from met_fields.f90 to mmif.f90.
2013-05-02  Added more sanity checks to inside_grid(), which gets called
            by both read_mm5() and read_wrf() after iBeg etc. calculated.
2013-05-02  Add fixed-control-file-format support for multiple outputs.
2013-05-03  Add per-line specification of location for AER* modes.
2013-05-06  Increased printing of Roughness lenght from F7.4 to F9.6.
2013-06-18  Moved check for supported landuse types to mmif.f90, which
            allowed the removal of logical force_run (no longer used).
2013-06-21  Changed all the nc* (netcdf version 2 C-style) calls to
            nf_* (netcdf version 3 Fortran-style) calls.
2013-07-12  For aggregation, use zPt(,) instead of zmid(), because the 
            latter is the average over the full 3-D domain.
2013-07-15  Added support for multiple CALPUFF output files from a single run.
2013-07-15  Moved call to calc_vptg() in mmif.f90 so only called when needed.
2013-07-15  Added point_in_grid() checking routine, and renamed 
            inside_grid() to grid_in_grid().
2013-07-15  Bug fix: when using KM to set output in quadrant 3 of the 
            domain, wrong grid cell was being selected.
2013-07-16  If useful filename ends in .csh, make a csh script instead
            of a batch file in onsite_header().
2013-07-16  Bug fix in legal_timestamp(), was returning range 0-24, when
            it should return either range 0-23 or 1-24.
2013-07-16  Fixed ending XDATES time, so AERMET runs stop when data does.
2013-07-16  Made screen output more regular and pretty.
2013-07-18  Prevent output of MM5/WRF levels below 15m in AER* modes.
2013-07-18  Updated sample_input() for new multi-out format.
2013-07-18  MMIFv3.0rc1 released.

2013-09-05  Auto-detect MM5 vs. WRF files, no need to specify MetForm.
2013-09-05  Started change from fixed-format to keyword-driven control file.
            New module parse_control.f90 added, in place of command_line.f90.
2013-09-20  Separated the *_header() routines, which also wrote the Useful 
            Info file, into *_useful() and *_header().  
2013-09-20  Made calmet_header() write EITHER a CALMET.DAT or a CALMET.AUX
            file, but not both in one call.
2013-09-21  All non-hourly outputs now open and close their files in their
            own subroutines.  Hourly files are still opened in mmif.f90.
2013-09-21  Bug fix: endif in the wrong place near the USGS/NLCD checks for
            missing z0,bowen,LAI (thanks to Bret Anderson for the report).
2013-09-23  Added support for several other land-use methods: NLCD40,
            MODIS, and IGBP_MODIS.  Also updated USGS to support 33 cats.
            Look-up tables have been updated, following MCIPv4.1 (see file
            metvars2ctm.f90, arrays laimod and laimnmod) and WRFv3.5.1 (see
            file run/LANDUSE.TBL).
2013-09-24  Moved the check for supported land-use types from read_mm5.f90 
            and read_wrf.90 to mmif.f90.
2013-09-28  Added support the each 1-D output to have its own timezone.

2014-10-09  Bug fix: only first AERSFC output file contained values.
2014-10-09  Improved detection of related outputs (useful info needs filenames)
2014-10-09  MMIFv3.2rc1 released.

2014-11-26  No reason RH needs to be rounded to nearest integer for aercoare.
2015-01-29  Added terrain elevation (topo) at the screen output for points.
2015-02-24  MEDOC time-stamps now forced to be in GMT, so LOCAL_MET = F.
2015-02-24  Updated Useful Info file based on discussions with SCICHEM authors.
2015-03-25  *.IN1's UPPERAIR block's LOCATION timezone should be point-specific.
2015-03-31  Change AER_MIN_SPEED to be calm, not set to min. speed.
2015-07-24  ONSITE bat/csh file should not include the path to the *.IN1 files.
2015-07-24  Uppercase just the filename, not path, for ONSITE output.
2015-07-24  MMIFv3.2 released.

2016-03-16  Bug fix: ZMID not the middle when using LAYERS MID keywords.

2016-03-17  Added AER_MIXHT option, possible values WRF, MMIF or AERMET.
2016-07-06  LCC > max possible - probably means Xlcc givin in meters, not km.
2016-08-05  Changed MIXHT to CALSCI_MIXHT to avoid confusion with AER_MIXHT.
2016-08-14  Don't write PROFILE-related stuff when none requested.

2017-02-16  Set default values for tlat1,tlat2 to support EM projections.
2017-06-20  New outputs: BLN, BNA, or KML of WRF and sub-domains, DAT

2017-06-20  Write a terr.lvl file with the CALMET terrain.
2017-06-23  Added LAI to MEDOC file, to support SCICHEM 3.2.

2018-02-07  Increased significant figures for DGRIDKM to support <1km grids.
2018-04-03  Added units to the MEDOC file for SCICHEM, supported by SCICHEM 3.2.
2018-05-02  Changed AER_MIN_SPEED from 0.5 to 0.0 m/s: revised MMIF guidance.
2018-05-04  Turned on STABLEBL ADJ_U* by default.
2018-07-17  Added detection of skipped/missing hours in MMIF output,
	    which can happen when there's a gap in WRF data.
2018-07-18  MMIFv3.4 released.

2018-11-24  Bug fix: cenlat,cenlon should be origlat,origlon in read_mm5.f90.
2018-12-21  Lon values in KML file did not have enough sig figs for lat<0.
2018-12-26  New keyword: CC (cloud cover) data source.
2018-12-26  Read WRF's CLDFRA output for use in cloud cover output.
2019-03-11  Bug fix: remove extra spaces in lat-lon strings in QAPLOT KML files.
2019-03-11  MMIFv3.4.1 released.

2019-09-05  Added "UAWINDOW -6 6 " keyword for AERMOD mode. At high latitudes, 
            the morning sounding falls outside the default "UAWINDOW -1 1" so  
	    no convective mixing heights were being calculated by AERMET. Only
	    affects "aer_mixht AERMET" modes. 
2019-11-08  Added reading CLDFRA, if it exists in MM5 files.
2019-11-08  Bug fix: some older versions of WRF don't have CLDFRA, so test

2020-11-30  Changed format statement for ASCII MEDOC files to avoid rounding
            roughness length values to 0.0000 (impossible value).
2020-12-15  When using MMIF’s re-diagnosis of the mixing height, use temporal 
            smoothing – the same as AERMET does.
