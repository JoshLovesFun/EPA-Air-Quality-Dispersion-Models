                               MPRM (dated 99349)


    The Meteorological Processor for Regulatory Models [MPRM (dated 99349)]
implements changes to MPRM necessary for Y2K compliance.  These changes
are incidental to the meteorological processing algorithms in MPRM;
consequently, users of MPRM should see little difference from past
versions other than, where necessary, the 'year' is reported as a
4-digit integer instead of a 2-digit integer.  MPRM (dated 99349) has
been tested using constructed meteorological files for the period
December 1999 through January 2000.  Test case files for Y2K compliance
(identified as Y2K-nnn.*) are archived with the general test case files
(identified as TESTnnn.*) in MPRM3.ZIP.  Documentation for the Y2K test
cases is provided in the text file: DEC15Y2K.LOG;  the general test cases
are documented in DEC15GEN.LOG.


    Details regarding the revised MPRM can be found in the Addendum to the
MPRM User's Guide (EPA-454/B-96-002).  The user's guide and the addendum are
available for downloading from the 'User's Guides / Related Programs' area
on the SCRAM main menu.  The user's guide is also available from NTIS
(document No. PB96-180518).  This documentation was not updated for
MPRM (dated 99349).  This file (MPRM.RME) provides update information.


    As provided on SCRAM, MPRM is comprised of six compressed format 'ZIP'
files.  The software to expand (unzip) these files 'PKUNZIP.EXE' is available
from the Systems Utilities area of SCRAM.  The six ZIP files are:

    The instructions provided in the following assume that the reader has
completed the initial learning curve for the Meteorological Processor for
Regulatory Models (MPRM) and has had some experience in using MPRM for
processing on-site meteorological data.

PROCESSING FOR GAS DRY DEPOSITION

    Processing of meteorological data for use in modeling gas dry deposition
takes place in Stage 3 of the MPRM processor.  The on-site surface parameters
required can be entered in Stage 2 or Stage 3 (the Stage 3 option is
recommended).  Default values, which are used if none are provided, are as
follows:

               Albedo                                  0.25
               Bowen Ratio                             0.70
               Roughness (measurement site)            0.15 m
               Roughness (application site)            0.15 m
               Minimum M-O Length                      2.00 m
               Surface Heat Flux (fraction of net)     0.15
               Anthropogenic Heat Flux                 0.00
               Leaf Area Index (LAI)                   3.00

    The general test case files provided with this release of MPRM
include an example (TEST324.INP) in which surface characteristics are
given by season of the year for two different downwind land-use types
(deciduous forest, and urban). Values used for the surface parameters in
this example were taken from the tables provided in the addendum to the
user's guide.

    Processing of meteorological data for use in modeling gas dry deposition
is activated by specifying 'ISCGASD' for dry deposition only, and 'ISCGASW'
for dry and wet deposition in the input record for model option in Stage 3.


EXAMPLE TEST CASES

    Example test cases for exercising various features in MPRM are provided
as follows:

     TEST322   Processing for ISCSTWET using NWS mixing heights and surface
               data with default surface characteristics.

     TEST323   Processing for ISCSTDRY using on-site data with user specified
               surface characteristics.  On-site stability is based on
               sigma-theta.

     TEST324   Processing for ISCSTWET using on-site data with user specified
               surface characteristics which vary by sector and season.
               On-site stability is based on the SRDT method.

    Experienced users of MPRM should note that command line piping
(i.e., STAGE3 < TEST001.INP) is not used in MPRM (dated 99349);  the
executables, STAGE1N2 and STAGE3 now prompt the user for an input file.
