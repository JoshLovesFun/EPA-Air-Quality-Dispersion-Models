                       MPRM (dated 93140)

     This Model Change Bulletin is to notify users of changes
made to correct problems and provide enhancements to the
Meteorological Processor for Regulatory Models, MPRM (dated
90045).  The revisions are summarized in the following.

     These revisions constitute MPRM (dated 93140) and completely
replace MPRM (dated 90045).  With this bulletin, the source codes
and executables for MPRM (dated 93140) are being made available
for downloading from the File Transfer Section of SCRAM.  MPRM
(dated 90045) is obsolete and, with this bulletin, will no longer
be available on SCRAM.  All copies of such should be discarded.

     Users of MPRM are referred to a companion WordPerfect 5.1
document (MPRMSUP.WPF) which provides supplemental information
and necessary revisions to the MPRM User's Guide.

     For tracking purposes, modifications have been assigned
identifying labels (B001, B002, etc. for 'bugs', and E001, E002,
etc. for enhancements).  This labeling convention is retained in
the following.


1.   Calms Processing - B001 - In MPRM (dated 90045), the last
     valid wind direction (LWD) in subroutines WS10S and WS1NWS
     (in MP4XFOR.FOR) was set too early resulting in erroneous
     data in the output file.  Necessary corrections were made in
     subroutines WS1OS and WS1NWS.


2.   Missing Data - B002 and B003 - In processing on-site data
     with MPRM (dated 90045), missing wind directions are
     erroneously treated as calms (i.e., the wind speed is set to
     1 m/s and the wind direction is set to the last valid wind
     direction value).  This is correct only if the wind speed is
     less than the threshold (OSCALM). Otherwise, the missing
     value indicator for wind direction (default value 999)
     should be retained through stage 3 processing.  In the
     latter case (problem B003), the wind speed is set correctly,
     but the wind direction and flow vectors are not.  These
     problems required an extensive re-write of subroutine WS1OS. 
     Also, several variable names were changed to improve
     clarity.  In particular, WDIR was changed to WFDIR, since it
     is really the flow direction, not the wind direction; and
     LWD was changed to LFD, since once again, it is the last
     flow direction that is saved, not the last wind direction.

3.  Stability Classification - B004 - With MPRM (dated 90045),
     stability class estimates using on-site wind speed and sigma
     theta do not verify with hand calculation for some cases.
     This problem was traced to an incorrect assignment of the
     array elements for albedo and roughness in subroutine ROUGH. 
     The code was corrected by changing OSSFC(  ,  ,  1) to
     OSSFC(  ,  ,  3), since roughness is the 3rd element of the
     array, not the 1st.

4.   Conversion of on-site ceiling height - B005 - MPRM (dated
     90045) does not correctly convert on-site ceiling height to
     the nearest 100's of feet.  This problem was traced to
     subroutine OS1PGT in MP4XFOR.FOR.  The statement 'CLHT =
     SFOBS(HR0124,33)' was corrected to read 'CLHT =
     OSSOBS(HR0124,33)'.

5.   Extraction of upper air data -B006 - With MPRM (dated
     90045), extraction of upper air data from a TD5600 file, may
     result in a SUBSCRIPT OUT OF RANGE error.  This problem was
     traced to an error in subroutine GETSDG.  The statement
     'IF(SDGPOS .GT. NCHB1) THEN ...' was corrected to read
     'IF(SDGPOS + NCHLEV .GE. NCHB1) THEN...'.

6.   Decoding overpunch characters -B007 - In MPRM (dated 90045),
     an invalid blank overpunch is incorrectly treated as a valid
     blank - this affects processing of temperature (wet-bulb,
     dry-bulb, and dew-point), wind speed, and cloud cover.  This
     problem was traced to subroutine SFLEVS.  Necessary changes
     were made such that invalid blank overpunches retain the
     initial assignment for overpunch variables (-99999) and,
     thus, are reported as missing.

7.   QA procedure for wind shear -B009 - In MPRM (dated 90045)
     there was some uncertainty that the QA of directional wind
     shear would accommodate traverses through 360 degrees.  This
     required review of the code in subroutine UAQASM.  It was
     concluded that this would not be a problem so long as the
     wind directions lie in the range of 0 to 360 degrees.  New
     code was added to ensure that this is the case. 

8.   Action item for PG Stability - B011 - In MPRM (dated 90045),
     the action item for estimating the PG stability using on-
     site wind speed and NWS observations of cloud amount and
     ceiling height 'WNDNWS' does not match what is specified in
     the user's guide (TABLE 4-1) and output in stage 3 'WNDWXX'. 
     This required changes to the MASTER and MP1 INCLUDE files. 
     All references to WNDNWS in these files were replaced by
     WNDWXX to conform to the user's guide.

9.  Need for upper air data in STAGE 3 - B014 - In MPRM (dated
     90045), STAGE 3 processing for climatological models (e.g.,
     STAR), which do not require mixing height data, proceeds
     normally without the UA pathway if the surface data are
     provided via the OS pathway.  However, processing is
     terminated if these data are provided via the SF pathway. 
     To get around this, users of MPRM (dated 90045) had to
     provide a "dummy" UA file in order to use SF pathway data in
     climatological models.  This problem was traced to
     subroutine MRPATH.  Necessary corrections were made to
     accommodate situations in which no UA pathway data are used,
     regardless of the source of surface meteorological data.

10.  INCLUDE Files - E001 - All INCLUDE files were given a '.INC'
     extension.  This facilitates compile operations by allowing
     use of a wildcard.

11.  Leading blanks - E002 - MPRM (dated 90045) incorrectly
     interprets leading blank fields as missing.  For example
     '_20' in the three column ceiling height field is
     interpreted as missing because the leading column is blank
     instead of zero.  This problem was traced to the
     interpretation of overpunch fields in the CD144 format for
     NWS surface data.  The default interpretation of leading
     blanks as missing was changed for NWS ceiling height,
     temperature, and wind speed.  Leading blanks for these
     variables are now processed correctly as leading zeros. 
     (see also item 6 - B007).

12.  Missing Data Reports -E003 - Audit reports from MPRM (dated
     90045) do not include the date and time for missing data -
     thus, users were forced to conduct a manual search for
     records with missing data.  The MPRM code was revised such
     that the date and time associated with each missing data
     item are included in the QA audit report file.  This fix is
     similar to the "trace" option available on the MP pathway.

13.  SCRAM Data - E009 - With MPRM (dated 90045), NWS surface
     data downloaded from SCRAM must be processed through the on-
     site (OS) pathway.  This is because SCRAM files, which are
     shortened versions of the standard CD144 file, have a
     different format than the CD144 format required by the
     surface (SF) pathway.  A new option 'SCRAMFB' was added to
     subroutine IN2CRD and a new section was added to subroutine
     SFEXT to enable direct processing of SCRAM data through the
     SF pathway.

14. ASCII Data for ISCST2 -E011 - Code was added to provide a
     formatted (ASCII) meteorological data file for use with
     ISCST2.  The format of this file is described on page 3-53
     of the ISC2 users guide.  A new label 'ISC2STA' was added to
     the list of dispersion models supported by MPRM to
     accommodate this new output file.

15.  Direct input of stability -E012 - Code was added to STAGE 3
     to bypass stability class processing and allow use of input
     stability class.  To invoke this enhancement, a new option
     'USERIN' was included in the MP pathway under the keyword
     VBL.
