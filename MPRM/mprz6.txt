                            MPRM (dated 99349)


     This Model Change Bulletin implements changes to the Meteorological
Processor for Regulatory Models (MPRM) necessary for Y2K compliance.
These changes are incidental to the meteorological processing algorithms
in MPRM; consequently, users of MPRM should see little difference from
past versions other than, where necessary, the 'year' is reported as a
4-digit integer instead of a 2-digit integer.

     These changes constitute MPRM (dated 99349).  With this bulletin the
source code and executables for MPRM (dated 99349) are being made available
for downloading from the 'Models / Related Programs' area of SCRAM.  MPRM
(dated 99349) replaces MPRM (dated 99155);  the old version is obsolete and,
with this bulletin, will no longer be available on SCRAM.

    This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian date,
i.e.: MPRM (dated 99349).  Future changes to this program will be identified
by an updated Julian date found at the beginning of the program source code
and followed by a reference to a SCRAM Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n)
which will explain the nature and content of the changes.  All Model Change
Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference on
this website.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this program
will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this website.
