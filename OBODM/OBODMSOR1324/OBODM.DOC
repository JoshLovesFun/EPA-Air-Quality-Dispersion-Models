CC**********************************************************************
CC     Last Update -
CC     03/05/96 - In sub. IDISC.FOR, call to IFNUL.FOR was corrected to
CC                a function reference rather than a call.
CC                In IOSCN.FOR, ibackt was used in a CLRPG.FOR call, but 
CC                should have been int*2.  int*2 iback was added and 
CC                replaced ibackt in the call.
CC                In SPDSP.FOR, irow and icol were corrected to int*2
CC                type variables.
CC     03/06-96 - In OBODM.FOR, linetl and ifrdwt were double defined.
CC     03/13/96 - In RLABL.FOR seasonal labels were changed from 
CC                season-1, season-2, etc. to winter, spring, summer
CC                and fall.
CC     07/09/96 - In OBODM.DOC, under constv, the definitions of ppb    070996
CC                and ppt were corrected.  Also, in subroutine DISPR    070996
CC                the conversion factors to convert ppm to ppb or ppt   070996
CC                were changed from 1.0e-3 to 1.0e3.  Also, corrected   070996
CC                an error in PLUMI and PLUMC.  When distance to final  070996
CC                plume rise is specified, the program uses the first   070996
CC                x,y point to determine the distance to final rise.    070996
CC                The program was erroneously using the distance to the 070996
CC                receptor, when the receptor distance was less than the070996
CC                maximum rise distance.  This affected only the first  070996
CC                x,y point calculated.                                 070996
CC     07/11/96 - Modified IDISC and STATB, so would turn off menu      071196
CC                function BACK if at the start of the files list and/or071196
CC                turn of NEXT if at the end of the files list.         071196
CC                iswopt(32) is now used to control these special cases.071196
CC     11/21/96 - Modified DISPR, was only checking to see if zpdist >  112196
CC                hmdpth if complex terrain was used.  Changed to check 112196
CC                always.                                               112196
CC                Also, when an old input file was read and had an x,y  112196
CC                coordinate data file specified, you could not turn it 112196
CC                off.  Now, if file name field is blank, the file name 112196
CC                is blanked.                                           112196
CC     02/07/97 - Modified command line options and added command line  020797
CC                option to swap y and z receptor axes.  Also, changed  020797
CC                debug (ifdbug) code.                                  020797
CC     03/07/97 - Added description of ifmode to obodm.doc.  Also,      030797
CC                error return code was improved from routine IFSRD.    030797
CC     03/12/97 - Corrected problem in PLTSQ and JFCTC where variable   031297
CC                should be character*2.                                031297
CC     07/11/97 - Corrected a problem where source inputs were not      071197
CC                checked for errors in RINPH.                          071197
CC     07/24/97 - Corrected errors in source data defaults and expanded 072497
CC                the maximum number of sources from 10 to 50.  These   072497
CC                required changes to the data save file contents,      072497
CC                requiring a change from version 1.2 to 1.3.  The      072497
CC                effected subroutines are: OBODM, RINPH, RINPK, RPRTB, 072497
CC                RMDLA, RPRTD, RMDLB, RINPC, RINDB, RPRTC, RINPL,      072497
CC                RINDA, RINPQ, GETID, SAVID, RPLTA.  Also, include     072497
CC                files OCALCS.INC, OCNTRL.INC, ONAMES.INC and          072497
CC                OWNTRL.INC and OBODM.DOC were changed.                072497
CC                moddat=07/24/97, ivrmod=0                             072497
CC     08/24/97 - Corrected code in GETD6 that was checking for input   082497
CC                saved data errors even though no input saved data was 082497
CC                being used.  This resulted in ERR being displayed for 082497
CC                data categories in the main menu when NONE should have082497
CC                been displayed.                                       082497
CC                Also, in GETD2 the first argument to ipack was a      082497
CC                constant and should have been set from the array      082497
CC                nsubsc for the correct number of menus for the data   082497
CC                item.                                                 082497
CC                moddat=08/24/97, ivrmod=1                             082497
CC     02/10/98 - Corrected code in DISPR so that initial source        021098
CC                dimensions (sigxop, sigyop and sigzop) are equal      021098
CC                for buoyant quasi-continuous sources to comply with   021098
CC                the derivation of the plume rise models.              021098
CC                moddat=02/10/98, ivrmod=2                             021098
CC     07/30/98 - Corrected output code that showed emission strength as073098
CC                G/S or per time.  Now shows only G or total units.    073098
CC                moddat=07/30/98, ivrmod=3                             073098
CC     08/12/98 - Corrected problem where program was not checking for  081298
CC                missing date/hours and sequence errors.  Also, added  081298
CC                program date to menu1.  Also, removed the word on from081298
CC                warning messages 16 and 17 (missing date, sequence    081298
CC                error) and changed missing date to llyrs rather than  081298
CC                iniyrs or expected date.                              081298
CC                moddat=08/12/98, ivrmod=4                             081298
CC     09/01/98 - Fixed error that did not recognize the character      090198
CC                abrevations for some units, subroutine LUNIT.         090198
CC                moddat=09/01/98, ivrmod=5                             090198
CC     09/04/98 - Corrected error that allowed iofhrs to be 1 for hour  090498
CC                limits 0100-2400, should have been 0.  Moved update   090498
CC                date to lower right corner of screen in menu 1.  Moved090498
CC                code after ROUTA and ROUTB that check to see if input 090498
CC                data was to be intialized to area near front of code  090498
CC                so after all of routines RMDLA, RMDLB, RMDLC, ROUTA   090498
CC                ROUTB were executed a check would be made.  This was  090898
CC                changed because if an error occurred in other routines090498
CC                data would not be reinitialized and some changed      090498
CC                could be within out to a user .OUT file, changing user090498
CC                data.  Corrected bug where would not append .inp to   090498
CC                batch input control (=) file when no extension was    090498
CC                entered.                                              090498
CC                moddat=09/04/98, ivrmod=6                             090498
CC     11/01/98 - Corrected code that failed to unpack concentration    110198
CC                arrays correctly, depending on data values and array  110198
CC                size.  Corrected parameter ifcalc so -1 indicates     110198
CC                source not operational, but zeros are included in     110198
CC                averages.  Corrected strange problem where the highest110198
CC                and second highest in array vmxhi were not being      110198
CC                printed correctly in OUTPT, removed vmxhi from OUTPT  110198
CC                arguments and used calcsa instead.  vmxhi is          110198
CC                equivalenced to calcsa in ROUTA and ROUTB.  Also,     110198
CC                corrected some minor labeling problems with table     110198
CC                headings, page numbers and table numbers.             110198 
CC                moddat=11/01/98, ivrmod=7                             110198
CC     11/10/98 - Corrected code in ISODA that errored the program off  110198
CC                when hourly source data was used.  Corrected code in  110198
CC                GETD1 that read Version 1.0 data incorrectly.         110198
CC                Changed code in ROUTA so that tables are not produced 111098
CC                for user excluded hours and OUTPT prints a message    111098
CC                that all values are zero when all receptors are zero, 111098
CC                rather than printing several pages of zeros.  Also,   111098
CC                corrected several minor labeling problems.            111098
CC                moddat=11/10/98, ivrmod=8                             111098
CC     12/06/98 - Corrected labeling problem where time-average calcs   120698
CC                time units were not labeled correctly when producing  120698
CC                graphics.                                             120698
CC                moddat=12/06/98, ivrmod=9                             120698
CC     12/10/98 - Corrected screen for displaying print files, was not  121098
CC                displaying "OBODM (Version" in the heading and had    121098
CC                Entr in the heading rather than Rtrn.  RINPC and STATB121098
CC                respectively were corrected.  Also, discovered if the 121098
CC                user scaled output using ascale and bscale and a .SOL 121098
CC                file and then went back and specified an input file   121098
CC                and executed the input file data, all in the same run,121098 
CC                the ascale and bscale values would scale all printed  121098
CC                results.  Changed this so ascale and bscale are always121098
CC                reset to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively.  Corrected bug    121098
CC                where hour counters were not being reset when running 121098
CC                batch brute force runs under the summary mode.  The   121098
CC                net effect of this error was the annual average for   121098
CC                the second batch run would be 1/2 what it should, the 121098
CC                third batch run would be 1/3 what it should, etc.     121098
CC                moddat=12/10/98, ivrmod=10                            121098
CC     12/21/98 - Corrected problem where the first 9 lines of date/time122198
CC                output in the highest and second highest tables were  122198
CC                printed as all zeros (routines ROUTA, ROUTB and OUTPT)122198
CC                moddat=12/21/98, ivrmod=11                            122198
CC     01/25/99 - Corrected problem where when sources were deleted or  012599
CC                duplicated (copied), some of the source parameters    012599
CC                were not copied correctly.  This was caused by        012599
CC                incorrect dimensioning of equivalenced source arrays  012599
CC                in subroutine RINPG.  This would affect any run where 012599
CC                any source except the last was deleted and any run    012599
CC                where any source was copied from another.             012599
CC                moddat=01/25/99, ivrmod=12                            012599
CC     03/04/99 - Corrected problem where results for batch runs using  030499
CC                hourly meteorological data did not compare to results 030499
CC                when run outside of a batch run.  Program was not     030499
CC                opening a new met. input data file or a new source    030499
CC                input data file if the previous batch file had already030499
CC                opened either file type.  Program listed name of met. 030499
CC                and source file, but did not open it because it       030499
CC                assumed it had already been opened.                   030499
CC                moddat=03/04/99, ivrmod=13                            030499
CC     01/04/00 - Added code to RMDLA to help identify data format      010400
CC                errors.  The program was allowing the friction        010400
CC                velocity and Monin-Obukhov length read from ISC3      010400
CC                dry deposition format data to be read as the wind     010400
CC                profile exponent and vertical potential temperature   010400
CC                gradient, respectively.  If the program was directed  010400
CC                to read ISC3 CARD format data, but the data were      010400
CC                ISC3 dry deposition format, this would cause the      010400
CC                program to calculate an incorrect wind speed and      010400
CC                incorrect plume rise, resulting in erroneous          010400
CC                concentration or deposition calculations.  The OBODM  010400
CC                program does not process ISC3 dry or wet deposition   010400
CC                format data.                                          010400
CC                Also, added function LEAPS to expand leap year        010400
CC                detection.  There was no problem in this area, the    010400
CC                code was expanded for completeness.                   010400
CC                Also, corrected bug in RINPQ where the program was not010400
CC                detecting an overflow of calculation points and       010400

CC                to 10 and the field contained a single trailing zero  021405
CC                with all other characters in the field blank and this 021405
CC                was the last data field in the record IFSRD returned  021405
CC                the value as missing (-1.0E20) rather than zero.      021405
CC                However, in calculations the missing value was treated021405
CC                as zero.  The field width of 30 will prevent this from021405
CC                reoccurring.                                          021405

CC     06/06/07 - Corrected problem in RINPK, RINDB where the code was  060607
CC                checking array IVARSO for values, but was checking by 060607
CC                summing (2) through (13), but should have been        060607
CC                checking only (2) through (4). This caused hourly     060607
CC                input source data to show NONE for source data in the 060607
CC                main menu.  Also, source greater than mixing depth was060607
