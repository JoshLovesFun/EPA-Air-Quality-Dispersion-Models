                         {F3 returns to current menu}                              
                                                                                
  A) INTERACTIVE DATA SCREEN MENUS -                                            
                                                                                
      Data values for both numeric and alphanumeric data are entered between
  the start and end brackets [] for the respective parameter.  Values cannot
  overwrite the start bracket or the end bracket.  Options for the parameter
  value are shown in parentheses ().  If a value already appears within the
  start and end brackets, it is the default value.  Numeric data may be
  entered as whole numbers 101, as decimal fractions 101.012 or in exponent
  form 1.01012E2.  Leading or trailing blanks are allowed for both numeric
  and alphanumeric values, but numeric values and data file names must not 
  contain imbedded blanks.  Either upper or lower case letters can be used.  
  Abbreviations for units must be strictly followed.  In order to save entered 
  data you must exit a menu via the Enter key.  Otherwise, If PgDn is used, 
  entered data may be lost.  If the program detects data errors, the screen 
  menu will be re-displayed if Enter was typed.  If PgDn was typed and errors 
  are detected, the menu may not be redisplayed, but when you return to the 
  main menu, the data section will be flagged with ERR.
