  C) FIXED FIELD FORMAT INPUT HOURLY METEOROLOGICAL AND/OR SOURCE DATA -        
                                                                                
      The user specifies via interactive screen menu which meteorological       
  or source variables are to be read from the input hourly data file(s).        
  Also, the user specifies the relative position in the input record of         
  the value for each input variable and the format (FORTRAN edit codes) 
  of the input data record.  There can be more values in the input record 
  than variables being read.  Input data values must appear in the same 
  field (data columns) in each input record.  Leading and trailing blanks 
  within an input field are ignored, but data must not contain imbedded 
  blanks.  Numeric data values may be entered as a whole number (101), 
  decimal fraction (101.012) or in exponent form (1.01102E2), depending 
  on the FORTRAN edit code specified for the data field.  If data errors 
  are detected (data out of range or erroneous characters), a message is 
  written to the print output file as to the nature of the error and where   
  it occurred.
