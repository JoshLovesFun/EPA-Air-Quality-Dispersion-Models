       The FORTRAN edit codes that can be used in the format specified for      
  the input data records are shown below.  Each code must be separated from     
  the next by a COMMA.                                                          
                                                                                
   Fw.d - Value is in whole number or decimal form and occupies a total of         
          w columns with d digits as the fractional part.  If the field
          contains a period (decimal point) it overrides the d value.  If
          no period is used and there are fewer than d digits, zeros are        
          appended to the left of the digits to form the fraction.
