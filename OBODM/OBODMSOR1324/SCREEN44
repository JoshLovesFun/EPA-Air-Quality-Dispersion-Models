  C) FIXED FIELD FORMAT INPUT HOURLY METEOROLOGICAL AND/OR SOURCE DATA          
     (CONTINUED) -                                                              
                                                                                
   BN   - Ignore all embedded or trailing blanks within a field (w columns).    
          The effect is to remove the blanks and right justify the field.       
                                                                                
   BZ   - Treat all embedded and trailing blanks within a field as zeros.       
                                                                                
   /    - Indicate end of record.  If the input data for a single hour          
          occupies more than one input record, the slash can be used to         
          divide the variable values into multiple records.  Do not precede     
          or follow the slash with a comma.  The FORTRAN edit codes between     
          the slashes are unique to that record, except for edit codes P, BN    
          and BZ.
