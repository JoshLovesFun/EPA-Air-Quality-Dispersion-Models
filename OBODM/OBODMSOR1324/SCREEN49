  F) FREE FIELD FORMAT DIGITIZED MAP DATA (CONTINUED) -                         
                                                                                
    The special code identifying the feature to be plotted is entered on the    
    input record image, followed by a blank, followed by the label.  A maximum  
    of 20 characters are used from the label.  The X,Y coordinate pairs         
    defining the map feature are entered on the next record image(s) with up    
    to 4 X,Y pairs (8 values) per input image.  Values must be separated by a   
    comma or a blank.  For closed features, the first X,Y point must equal the  
    last.  For discontinuous features, use multiple code and X,Y pair record    
    groups to define each continuous segment.
