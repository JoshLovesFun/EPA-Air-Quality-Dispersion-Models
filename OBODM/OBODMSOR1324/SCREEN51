                            QUANTITIES CALCULATED 
                     {Use F3 to return to current menu} 
  Peak-Concentra- Maximum hourly quantity of pollutant/species material
  tion            in mass per unit volume of air. 
  Dosage        - Time-integrated concentration of pollutant/species
                  material in mass-time per unit volume of air.
  Time-average  - Concentration averaged over a user specified time interval,
                  where the averaging time can be less than or greater than
                  the source release (duration) time.  A single time-average
                  concentration value is calculated, generally with an
                  averaging time less than or equal to one hour (15 min,
                  30 min, etc.), for the meteorological data hour.  The user
                  then has the option of further averaging these values over
                  N-hour periods.  Time-average concentration is calculated
                  by centering the averaging time around the peak concen-
                  tration distribution.  The units are mass per unit volume
                  of air.
  Gravitational - Ground level total accumulation of material in mass per unit
  Deposition      area due to the gravitational settling of pollutant/species
                  material.  If dosage, con. or other quantity is calculated
                  along with grav. deposition, then the other quantities are
                  depleted due to the gravitational settling of particles.
                  A particulate distribution must be included in the source
