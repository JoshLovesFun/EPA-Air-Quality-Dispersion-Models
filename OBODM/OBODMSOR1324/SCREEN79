                  gravitational deposition is desired.

       The mode used to save hourly or N-hour average dispersion calculations
  is set via the print and auxiliary options menu.  The detailed mode (D)
  saves each calculated hour for each source on disk to be retrieved for
  printing or plotting desired averages and source combinations.  A maximum
  of 1 year of data (8784 hours) is allowed.  The summary (S) mode saves
  only final averages on disk.  These include: seasonal (quarterly),
  annual, maximum-50, highest and second highest averages.  Source grouping
  must be specified in the print and auxiliary options menu.  Up to 6
  averaging times can be specified for each source group.  An unlimited
  number of hours is allowed under the summary mode.

        The only time you can use an averaging time greater than one hour is
  when the actual detonation or burn is less than 1-hour and could only occur
  for one of the modeled hours during a day.  For example, if we have a
  single source that is to be detonated during some unknown hour of the day
  and 8-hour average concentration is desired.  Set the possible hours the
  source could be detonated in the source data menu (detonation window,
