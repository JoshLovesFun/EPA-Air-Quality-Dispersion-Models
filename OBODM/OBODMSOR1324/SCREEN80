  permitted hours).  Under output options select time-average concentration.
  Set the averaging time to 8 hours.  Select the output tables desired -
  maximum-50, Highest and Second Highest tables.  This method selects the
  maximum 8-hour value that could occur during the day.  These calculations
  cannot be further averaged.

        For print output table averages where the number of hours in
  each average are specified by N=[_],[_],etc. specify the number of
  hours for the measurement or standard, generally 1, 3, 8 and 24 hours.
  Each average uses a unique set of contiguous hours, not a running or
  overlapping average.  If the averaging time is greater than 1 hour,
  the program will only let you select 1 for this option, because only
  one event could possibly occur during a day invalidating any averaging.

  Output Table Labels:

  "Maximum 50 1-hour average hydrogen chloride time-average (15-min)
  concentrations": This label indicates a single 15 minute average
  concentration was calculated for each hour of the data period.  To
