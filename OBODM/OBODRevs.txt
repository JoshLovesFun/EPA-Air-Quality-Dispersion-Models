Corrections to the OBODM code include:

Version 1.3.xxxx (xxxx = ivrmod below in each update)

02/10/98 - Corrected code in DISPR so that initial source        
           dimensions (sigxop, sigyop and sigzop) are equal      
           for buoyant quasi-continuous sources to comply with   
           the derivation of the plume rise models.              
           moddat=02/10/98, ivrmod=0002                             
07/30/98 - Corrected output code that showed emission strength as
           G/S or per time.  Now shows only G or total units.    
           moddat=07/30/98, ivrmod=0003                             
08/12/98 - Corrected problem where program was not checking for  
           missing date/hours and sequence errors.  Also, added  
           program date and revision number to menu01.  Also, removed
           the word on from warning messages 16 and 17 (missing date,
           sequence error) and changed missing date to llyrs rather
           than iniyrs or expected date.                              
           moddat=08/12/98, ivrmod=0004                             
09/01/98 - Fixed error that did not recognize the character      
           abrevations for some units, subroutine LUNIT.         
           moddat=09/01/98, ivrmod=0005                             
09/04/98 - Corrected error that allowed iofhrs to be 1 for hour  
           limits 0100-2400, should have been 0.  Moved
           code after ROUTA and ROUTB that checks to see if input 
           data was to be intialized to area near front of code,  
           so after all of routines RMDLA, RMDLB, RMDLC, ROUTA   
           ROUTB were executed a check would be made.  This was 
           changed because if an error occurred in other routines,
           data would not be reinitialized and some changed data     
           could be written out to a user .OUT file, changing user
           data.  Corrected bug where program would not append .inp to   
           batch input control (=) file when no extension was    
           entered.                                              
           moddat=09/04/98, ivrmod=0006                             
11/01/98 - Corrected code that failed to unpack concentration    
           arrays correctly, depending on data values and array  
           size.  Corrected parameter ifcalc so -1 indicates     
           source not operational, but zeros are included in     
           averages.  Corrected strange problem where the highest
           and second highest in array vmxhi were not being      
           printed correctly in OUTPT, removed vmxhi from OUTPT  
           arguments and used calcsa instead.  vmxhi is          
           equivalenced to calcsa in ROUTA and ROUTB.  Also,     
           corrected some minor labeling problems with table     
           headings, page numbers and table numbers.              
           moddat=11/01/98, ivrmod=0007                             
11/10/98 - Corrected code in ISODA that errored the program off  
           when hourly source data was used.  Corrected code in  
           GETD1 that read Version 1.0 data incorrectly.         
           Changed code in ROUTA so that tables are not produced 
           for user excluded hours and OUTPT prints a message    
           that all values are zero when all receptors are zero, 
           rather than printing several pages of zeros.  Also,
           corrected several minor labeling problems.  
           moddat=11/10/98, ivrmod=0008                             
12/06/98 - Corrected labeling problem where time-average calcs 
           time units were not labeled correctly when producing
           graphics.
           moddat=12/06/98, ivrmod=0009
12/10/98 - Corrected screen for displaying print files, was not  
           displaying "OBODM (Version" in the heading and had    
           Entr in the heading rather than Rtrn.  RINPC and STATB
           respectively were corrected.  Also, discovered if the 
           user scaled output using ascale and bscale and a .SOL 
           file and then went back and specified an input file   
           and executed the input file data, all in the same run, 
           the ascale and bscale values would scale all printed  
           results.  Changed this so ascale and bscale are always
           reset to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively.  Corrected bug    
           where hour counters were not being reset when running 
           batch brute force runs under the summary mode.  The   
           net effect of this error was the annual average for   
           the second batch run would be 1/2 what it should, the 
           third batch run would be 1/3 what it should, etc.     
           moddat=12/10/98, ivrmod=0010                            
12/21/98 - Corrected problem where the first 9 lines of date/time
           output in the highest and second highest tables were
           printed as all zeros (routines ROUTA, ROUTB and OUTPT)
           moddat=12/21/98, ivrmod=0011
01/25/99 - Corrected problem where when sources were deleted or
           duplicated (copied), some of the source parameters 
           were not copied correctly.  This was caused by 
           incorrect dimensioning of equivalenced source arrays 
           in subroutine RINPG.  This would affect any run where
           any source except the last was deleted and any run
           where any source was copied from another. 
           moddat=01/25/99, ivrmod=12 
03/04/99 - Corrected problem where results for batch runs using
           hourly meteorological data did not compare to results
           when run outside of a batch run.  Program was not
           opening a new met. input data file or a new source
           input data file if the previous batch file had already
           opened either file type.  Program listed name of met.
           and source file, but did not open it because it
           assumed it had already been opened.
           moddat=03/04/99, ivrmod=13
01/04/00 - Added code to RMDLA to help identify data format      
           errors.  The program was allowing the friction        
           velocity and Monin-Obukhov length read from ISC3      
           dry deposition format data to be read as the wind     
           profile exponent and vertical potential temperature   
           gradient, respectively.  If the program was directed  
           to read ISC3 CARD format data, but the data were      
           ISC3 dry deposition format, this would cause the      
           program to calculate an incorrect wind speed and      
           incorrect plume rise, resulting in erroneous          
           concentration or deposition calculations.  The OBODM  
           program does not process ISC3 dry or wet deposition   
           format data.                                          
           Also, added function LEAPS to expand leap year        
           detection.  There was no problem in this area, the    
           code was expanded for completeness.                   
           Also, corrected bug in RINPQ where the program was not
           detecting an overflow of calculation points and       
           calculation quantities when operated in the summary   
           mode.                                                 
           moddat=01/04/99, ivrmod=14                            
01/07/00 - Continued with related areas for updates under 010400 
           above.  Also, added more information to the help      
           menus.  Increased screens from 78 to 81.              
           moddat=01/07/99, ivrmod=15                            
02/28/00 - Under certain model conditions time-average concen- 
           trations exceeded maximum peak concentrations.  This
           has changed to not allow time-average concentration 
           to exceed maximum peak concentration.  Also, corrected
           a problem where time-average concentration was being
           under-estimated for quasi-continuous sources when   
           dosage was also being calculated.                   
           moddat=02/28/00, ivrmod=16                          
07/17/00 - When input rectangular discrete coordinates were input
           in feet, the y coordinate was not being converted to  
           meters, resulting in incorrect results. Sub=RPRTD.FOR 
           moddat=07/17/00, ivrmod=17                            
09/05/00 - Added option to turn off printing of calm wind warning
           messages.
           moddat=09/05/00, ivrmod=17a
05/18/01 - Corrected error where volume units of liters were   
           being calculated incorrectly.  The prog was using 
           1.0e3 as a conversion factor, but should have been 
           using 1.0e-3.                                           
           moddat=05/18/01, ivrmod=18
01/14/03 - Modified program so user can now enter a flagpole     
           height for each grid receptor.  Previously you could  
           only specify one flagpole height for the entire grid  
           system.                                               
           Corrected problem where program would not allow annual
           or seasonal calculations under certain conditions     
           associated with flagpole receptors or misstaking      
           flagpole receptors for complex terrain.               
           Also, corrected problem where date/time was printed   
           incorrectly for highest and second-highest tables     
           when a large grid was used and multiple quantities    
           (dos., con., etc.) were calculated.  Also, added      
           counters to processing display that indicate number of
           calms, missing data and data errors.                  
           moddat=01/14/03, ivrmod=19 (combines mods from 12/07/02)
05/15/03 - Added two options. You can now specify if the wind    
           direction in user specified met. file formats is from 
           or towards (vector) when using hourly data.  Single   
           hour runs are allways direction from.  Preprocessed   
           ISCST3 data are allways towards (vector).  You can now
           turn off printing of met. data error and warning      
           messages.  Routines changed are obodm.for, rindb.for  
           rinpq.for, rmdla.for, rinpm.for, rprtc.for            
           moddat=05/15/03, ivrmod=20
09/29/04 - Corrected error where met. data limits were not       
           allowed to change for wind speed, direction, power law
           and turbulent intensities.                    
           moddat=09/29/04, ivrmod=21                            
02/14/05 - Corrected problem in RMDLA, ISODA, and RPLTF where the   
           field width in calls to IFSRD where too small for      
           actual data fields being read and was changed from 10
           to 30.  if the actual field width was greater than or
           equal to 10 and the field contained a single trailing zero
           with all other characters blank and it was the last data
           field in the record, then IFSRD returned the value as
           missing (-1.0E20) rather than zero.  However, in calculations
           the missing value was treated as zero.  The field value of
           30 will prevent this problem from reoccurring.
           moddat=02/14/05, ivrmod=22                            
04/18/06 - Corrected problem in RPLTF where it was not allowing 
           negative coordinates and was not converting x,y units
           correctly when plotting special map features.        
           Also, units conversion in area and volume have been  
           correctedin OBODM and RPLTD                          
           moddat=04/18/06, ivrmod=23
06/06/07 - Corrected problem in RINPK, RINDB where the code was  
           checking array IVARSO for values, but was checking by 
           summing (2) through (13), but should have been        
           checking only (2) through (4). This caused hourly     
           input source data to show NONE for source data in the 
           main menu.  Also, source greater than mixing depth was
           causing a user reponse to the warning on each         
           occurrance, so changed to no user response.  Also,    
           part of a warning message was left on the screen      
           during processing and was cleaned up.                 
           moddat=06/06/07, ivrmod=24
