OBODM Version 01.3.0024

This version corrects a bug in the processing of hourly source input data

*************************************************************************


To install the OBODM program from the EPA SCRAM web site:

1) Download all files into a subdirectory (e.g. c:\OBODM\Download) from SCRAM
2) Copy OBOD1324.zip to C:\OBODM and unzip the contents.  Example3 will 
     have to be unzipped there also.  OBODM1324.EXE is a self-extracting
     program that will install OBODM in the directory where it is 
     being extracted.
3) copy OBODMSOR.TXT and OBODMSOR.ZIP to C:\OBODM\source 
     and unzip the contents.
4) Copy all documentation to C:\OBODM\DOC and unzip the files as necessary.
5) Read through the documentation until you understand the model and how it 
     works.

If you desire a different named directory, then create the desired directory,
on the desired drive and copy OBOD1324.EXE to that desired directory and 
then type:

   OBOD1324.EXE

OBOD1324.EXE is a self-extracting file that will unpack the OBODM program
and related files.  OBOD1324.EXE can then be deleted from this directory
to conserve space.

If you get the message "Authenticity Verification Failed!", then the files
have been tampered with or are corrupt.  Delete the newly installed files and
obtain a new copy of the OBOD1324.EXE self-extracting file.

IF you get the message "Authentic files Verified!" or no message, the
installed files are ok.

If you run into problems or have questions, please contact us through 
the SCRAM web site "Contact Us" links.
