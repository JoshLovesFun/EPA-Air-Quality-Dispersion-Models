                     Model Change Bulletin
              
                            MCB#1                7/1/93

                       OCD (dated 93111)


     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the
activities of the SCRAM BBS for the Offshore and Coastal
Dispersion (OCD) model.  This model was developed through and is
being maintained by Minerals Management Services (MMS) of
Washington, DC.  The current code is slightly modified from MMS's
OCD Version 4.0.  The changes are described in a memorandum from
John Goll of MMS to Joseph Tikvart of EPA.  The contents of that
memo are included with the OCD archival file as GOLLTIK.WPF and
Attachment 2 to the memo is also included as ATTACH2.WPF.  The
attachment contains the results of a model performace evaluation
that was done to compare the current OCD model with OCD 4.0.

     EPA will henceforth identify this model by its name and a
julian date, i.e.: OCD (dated 93111).  Future changes to this
model will be identified by an updated julian date in the
the model source code header and followed by a reference
to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n) which will explain
the nature and contents of the changes.  All Model Change
Bulletins for this model will always be available for back
reference on this BBS.  In the future, notification of changes
(MCBs) to this model will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section
of this BBS immediately following the LOGON procedure.

     The source code for this model has been compiled and tested
with the Lahey (v4.1), Microsoft(v5.0), and a SUN (v1.0) Fortran
compilers by MMS.  Watch SCRAM ALERTS for notification of new
MCBs about OCD.

                       * Important Note *  
                       ******************
   
      New Model Change Bulletins will ONLY be issued when there
is a change to the source code for this model.  Changes to test
cases and/or any pre and post processors that are included in the
archived file for this model will be addressed and appropriately
identified in an amendment to the model's latest MCB with
notification posted in the SCRAM ALERTS section of the BBS.
