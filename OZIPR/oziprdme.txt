                                   OZIPR                           February 2005


                      
This file provides introductory information and describes the files related
to the OZIPR (Ozone Isopleth Plotting Program Revised) model.

This update to the OZIP model provides (1) a simple trajectory model capable
of utilizing complex chemical mechanisms, emissions, and various
meteorological parameters, and (2) procedures through which the Empirical
Kinetics Modeling Approach (EKMA) can be implemented for calculation of
emission reductions needed to achieve compliance with the National Ambient
Air Quality Standard for ozone.

The following describes the OZIPR package and indicates where the files can be 
found on the website shell that presents this ReadMe:
