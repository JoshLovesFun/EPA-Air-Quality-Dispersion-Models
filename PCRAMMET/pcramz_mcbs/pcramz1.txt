                        Model Change Bulletin

                                MCB#1                               9/9/95

     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the activities of the
SCRAM BBS for this program.

      The PCRAMMET program code available from this bulletin board
is a PC compatible version for use of processing meteorological data for
refined short-term models, particularly ISCST3.  A program named RAMMET is
also available from SCRAM, but has not been updated with options needed for
ISCST3.  Other differences in PCRAMMET and RAMMET concern the random numbers
that are included in the code in data statements and an executable module
from Microsoft Fortran is also included.
  
      This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian
date, i.e.: PCRAMMET (dated 95227). Future changes to this program will be
identified by an updated julian date found on the first line of the model
source code and followed by a reference to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin
(MCB#n) which will explain the nature and contents of the changes. All Model
Change Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference
on this BBS. In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this model will
be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this BBS immediately following the
LOGON procedure.
