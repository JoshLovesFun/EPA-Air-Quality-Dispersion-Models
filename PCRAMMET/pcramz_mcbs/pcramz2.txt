     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the update of the
PCRAMMET (dated 95300) program located on the SCRAM BBS.

     PCRAMMET (dated 95300) corrects problems relating to the treatment of
variable length TD3240 precipitation data.  Previously, PCRAMMET would abort
in error when processing variable length precipitation data.  In addition,
two files were added to the PCRMCODE.ZIP file, namely F77L-PCR.BAT and
FLMS-PCR.BAT.  The F77L-PCR.BAT file is a batch file used to recompile the
PCRAMMET source code and correctly link using the Lahey compiler.  Likewise,
the FLMS-PCR.BAT file is a batch file used to recompile the PCRAMMET source
code and correctly link using the Microsoft compiler.

     PCRAMMET is now offered only in Lahey compiled format on the SCRAM BBS.
The Lahey compiler optimizes available memory on newer computers and therefore
decreases run-time.  This compiler also requires that a math co-processor be
available on the computer.

      This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian
date, i.e.: PCRAMMET (dated 95300).  Future changes to this program will be
identified by an updated Julian date found on the first line of the model
source code and followed by a reference to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin
(MCB#n) which will explain the nature and contents of the changes.  All Model
Change Bulletins for this program will always be available for back reference
on this BBS.  In the future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this model will
be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this BBS immediately following the
LOGON procedure.
