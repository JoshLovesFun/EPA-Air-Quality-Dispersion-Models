                        PCRAMMET (dated 98226)



     This Model Change Bulletin initiates the update of the PCRAMMET (dated 
98181) program located on the SCRAM web site under Models/Related Programs.

     PCRAMMET (dated 98226) adds the capability to process meteorological data 
that have been retrieved from the Hourly United States Weather Observations 
(HUSWO) compact disc (CD) for 1990-1995.  Additionally, PCRAMMET requires that 
global horizontal radiation and relative humidity be retrieved from the SAMSON 
or HUSWO CD if dry or wet deposition is selected in response to the type of 
calculations.  Hourly observations acquired with the Automated Surface
Observing System (ASOS) appear on the HUSWO CD.  With the introduction of the
ASOS-derived data, the total and opaque cloud cover fields are both reported
as 99 (missing). In PCRAMMET, the ASOS-derived cloud layer data are converted
to fractional cloud cover.  See the PCRAMMET User's Guide for further
details.

     PCRAMMET is offered only in Lahey-compiled format on the SCRAM web site.  
This compiler requires that a floating point unit be available either on the 
main processor (Intel 80486 DX or better) or a separate math coprocessor.

     This program will henceforth be identified by its name and a Julian
date, i.e.: PCRAMMET (dated 98226).  Future changes to this program will be
identified by an updated Julian date found on the first line of the model
source code and followed by a reference to a SCRAM web site Model Change
Bulletin (MCB#n) which will explain the nature and contents of the changes.
All Model Change Bulletins for this program will always be available for
back reference on this web site. In the future, notification of changes
(MCBs) to this model will be made in the Model Change Bulletins/Related
Programs section of this web site.
