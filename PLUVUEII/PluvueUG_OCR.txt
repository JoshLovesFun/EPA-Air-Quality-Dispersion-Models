1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1. 1 Overview 
Sources of air pollution located near Class I areas such as national parks and 
wilderness areas are required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Visibility regulations to evaluate the impact 
of their facility on such Class I areas. The Workbook for Plume Visual Impact Screening and 
Analysis (Revised) (EPA, 1992) recommends the use of a plume visual impact screening 
model (VISCREEN) for two successive levels of screening (Levels 1 and 2). A detailed 
plume visual impact analysis (Level 3) is conducted using the more sophisticated plume 
visibility model, PLUVUE II. . 

The PLUVUE II model described in this document refers to a restructured and revised 
version of the original PLUVUE II model described in the User's Manual for the Plume 
Visibility Model (PLUVUE ll) (EPA, 1984a and EPA, 1984b). The model was restructured in 
order to improve the user interface and computing requirements and revised to remove several 
errors in the original PLUVUE II code. The PLUVUE II algorithm is basically the same 
algorithm as developed in 1984, except for some changes to correct computer coding errors 
and to use "lookup" tables for the calculation of the phase functions. Also, a program has 
been designed to assist the user with the application of the PLUVUE II visibility model on a 
personal computer by allowing the user to prepare an input file, select or create a library of 
Mie calculations to reduce computational time, and run the PLUVUE II model. This program 
is referred to as the RUNPLUVU visibility modeling system. In addition, this user's guide, 
which duplicates many of the sections contained in the original (EPA, 1984a) user's guide, 
has been transferred to WordPerfect 5.1 for easy downloading from the EPA's Technology 
Transfer SCRAM bulletin board. 

The objective of the PLUVUE II model is to calculate visual range reduction and 
atmospheric discoloration caused by plumes consisting of primary particles, nitrogen oxides, 
and sulfur oxides emitted by a single emission source. Primary emissions of sulfur dioxide 
(S02) and nitric oxide (NO) do not scatter or absorb light and therefore do not cause visibility 
impairment. However, these emissions are converted in the atmosphere to secondary species 
that do scatter or absorb light and thus have the potential to cause visibility impairment. S02 
emissions are converted to sulfate (S04=) aerosols. These aerosols are generally formed or 
grow to a size (0.1 to 1.0 pm) that is effective in scattering light. NO emissions are 
converted to nitrogen dioxide (N02) gas, which is effective in absorbing light. In turn, N02 is 
converted to nitric acid vapor (HN03), which in turn neither absorbs nor scatters light. In 
some situations, nitric acid may form ammonium nitrate or organic nitrate aerosol, which 
scatters light. However, in many nonurban plumes, nitrate probably remains as HN03 vapor 
without visual effects. Eventually, all primary particles, secondary aerosols, and gases in a 
plume are removed from the atmosphere as a result of surface deposition and precipitation 

1 



scavenging. PLUVUE II is designed to predict the transport, atmospheric diffusion, chemical 
conversion, optical effects, and surface deposition of point and area source emissions. 

The PLUVUE II model uses a Gaussian formulation for transport and dispersion. The 
spectral radiance I(A.) (i.e., the intensity of light) at 39 visible wavelengths (0.36 < A. < 0.75 
pm) is calculated for views with and without the plume. The changes in the spectrum are 
used to calculate various parameters that predict the perceptibility of the plume and contrast 
reduction caused by the plume (Latimer et al., 1978). The four key perception parameters for 
predicting visual impact are: 

reduction in visual range; 

contrast of the plume against a viewing background at the 0.55 pm wavelength; 

blue-red ratio of the plume; and 

color change perception parameter LlE(L*a*b*). 

1.2 Limitations of the System 
The plume visibility model PLUVUE IT was evaluated with the 1981 VISTT A data 
base which was collected in the vicinity of the Kincaid Generating Station near Springfield, 
Illinois, and the Magma Copper Smelter near San Manuel, Arizona. Details of the model 
evaluation results are given in Seigneur et al. (1983). 

For applications to distant Class I areas (more than 50 km from the emission source), 
the model is less accurate because of mesoscale wind speed, wind direction, and stability 
variations. Thus, the use of a Gaussian-based model for downwind distances greater than 50 
km to predict visual effects is probably a conservative approach; however, this has not yet 
been demonstrated conclusively. Visual impacts for horizontal lines of sight are inversely 
proportional to the vertical extent of plume mixing. This vertical extent of plume mixing is 
defined by the vertical plume dispersion parameter ( crz) and, at farther distances downwind, 
by the mixing depth. Thus, errors in predicting vertical plume dimensions will carry 
throughout the calculations of plume visibility impacts. However, until field measurements of 
mesoscale plume transport and diffusion are carried out, and until better models based on 
these data are developed and verified, the EPA does not know of a better approach to model 
plume dispersion for the purposes of plume visual impact analysis. 

Other limitations are basic to the chemical mechanism used in PLUVUE II to predict 
the conversion of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Although this mechanism is a reasonable 
approximation for most applications in nonurban areas, it is not valid for applications in 
photochemical (urban) atmospheres or for sources of significant quantities of reactive 

2 



hydrocarbons. For such applications, photochemical plume models or regional models should 
be used. 

Other approximations are used in the atmospheric optics calculations and are discussed 
in Latimer et al. (1978). These approximations probably do not introduce significant errors in 
most situations; however, this has not yet been demonstrated. Terrain viewing backgrounds 
are idealized as white, gray, and black objects. The background atmosphere is treated as two 
layers; a homogeneous, surface mixed layer and a relatively clean upper-atmosphere layer. 
Diffusion radiation is calculated by integrating ·an angle-dependent radiance field according to 
the algorithm of Isaacs (1981). Errors in predicting diffuse-radiation intensities may 
adversely affect the accuracy of spectral radiance calculations, but not necessarily the 
accuracy of calculations of plume contrast, color differences, and reduction in visual range. 
In PLUVUE II, the calculated visual impact of a plume is quantified using coloration, color 
difference, and contrast parameters that are related to human visual perception. 

1.3 User's Guide Organization 
A technical overview of PLUVUE II, PLUIN2 (algorithm which allows the user to 
edit PLUVUE II input files), and MIETBL (algorithm which allows the user to create Mie 
library files as input to PLUVUE II) is presented in Section 2.0. Detailed RUNPLUVU user 
instructions including the basic computer requirements, detailed operating instructions, and a 
Level-3 plume visibility example are presented in Section 3.0. The references are given in 
Section 4.0.

2.0 TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 
The PLUVUE II visibility modeling system combines three different algorithms: 
PLUVUE II, PLUIN2, and MIETBL into one algorithm called RUNPLUVU. The user of 
RUNPLUVU may edit PLUVUE II input files (PLUIN2 portion of RUNPLUVU), select or 
create Mie library files as input to PLUVUE II (MIETBL portion of RUNPLUVU), and run 
the PLUVUE II visibility algorithm:

This section gives a detailed overview of the technical aspects of each routine. The PLUVUE 
II technical discussion is derived primarily from EPA (1984a). Section 2.1 presents in detail 
the PLUVUE II pollutant transport, diffusion, and removal processes; atmospheric chemistry; 
aerosol size distribution; atmospheric optics; geometry of the plume, observer, and sun; and 
how visibility impairment is quantified. Section 2.1 also discusses the most recent 
modifications made to the PLUVUE-II algorithm and the required input data. A description 
of PLUIN2 is provided in Section 2.2. Section 2.3 presents in detail a description of 
MIETBL including a discussion of Mie scattering theory, how Mie calculations are performed 
within MIETBL, and the accuracy of the Mie calculation methodology. A comparison of the 
revised PLUVUE II with the original PLUVUE II algorithm is given in Section 2.4 and the 
Appendix. 

2.1 PLUVUE II 
The modeling of visibility impairment requires mathematical descriptions for the 
following physical and chemical atmospheric processes in succession: 

Emissions; 

Atmospheric transport, diffusion, and removal; 

Chemical and physical reactions and transformations of precursors in the atmosphere; 

5 



Light scattering and absorption characteristics of the resultant aerosol; and 

Radiative transfer through the aerosol along different lines of sight. 

2.1.1 Pollutant Transport, Diffusion, and Removal 
There are two scales that are of interest in visibility impairment calculations. They 
require two different types of models: 

A near-source plume model designed to predict the incremental impact of one 

emission source (such as a power plant or smelter) . 

. A regional model designed to predict, over time periods of several days, the impacts 
of several emissions sources within a region whose spatial scale is in the range of 
1000 km. 

Calculation of near-source visual impacts, which is the design objective of 
PLUVUE II, requires a basic model that accurately predicts the spatial distribution of 
pollutants and the chemical conversion of NO to N02 and SOx and NOx to sulfates and 
nitrates. The plume model must be capable of handling the spatial scale from emissions at 
the source to at least 100 km downwind. Because the regional-scale problem may be caused 
by the long-range transport of pollutants over a spatial scale of 1000 km, an air quality model 
is needed that can account for multiple sources and for temporal variations in mixing heights, 
dispersion parameters, emission rates, reaction rates, and wind speed and direction. This 
second type of model, a regional visibility model, is beyond the scope ofthis user's manual. 
PLUVUE II is a near-source plume visibility model. 

Initial Dilution in a Buoyant Pl~me 

Modeling of the initial dilution of a plume from the top of the stack to the point of final 
plume rise is important when modeling the conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen 
dioxide (N02) in a power plant plume because of the quick quenching of the thermal oxidant 
of NO. The rate of this reaction is second order with respect to NO concentrations; therefore, 
the rate is fastest in the initial stages of plume dilution. It is also important to account for the 
initial dilution of buoyant releases because the rate of dilution caused by the turbulent 
entrainment of ambient air by a rising plume parcel can be considerably greater than that 
indicated by diffusion coefficients based on measurements for nonbuoyant releases (e.g., 
Pasquill-Gifford a), a,). Thus, initial plume dilution during plume rise should be taken into 
account to calculate accurately both plume dilution and atmospheric chemistry. 

Briggs ( 1969) sugges_ted that the characteristic plume radius (~) increases linearly w·ith 
the height of the plume above the stack and can be represented as follows: 


6 



(1)
RP =0.5 (Ah) 

Briggs described the plume rise (M), as a function of downwind distance (the "2/3 power 
law"), as follows: 

(2) 
where F is the buoyancy flux, x is the downwind distance, and u is the wind speed. For 
initial dilution, we can assume that the plume is circular in cross section and has a Gaussian 
proftle. We can also assume that the radius of the plume is the distance from the plume 
centerline to the point at which the plume concentration is 10 percent of the centerline 
concentrations. Thus, we have 

(3) 
where cry is the horizontal dispersion coefficient and crz is the vertical dispersion coefficient. . 
The concentration (X) of a given species at the centerline of the plume can be calculated by a 
modified Gaussian model that can be represented as 

(4) 
where Vis the velocity of the parcel, which has a horizontal component (the wind speed u) 
and a vertical component w, which can be calculated by differentiating Equation (2). Thus 

(5) 
where t is the time traveled. With this formulation, time-dependent plume temperature and 
NO concentrations can be calculated for accurately predicting the thermal oxidation of NO 
during plume rise. 

Combining Equations (1), (3), and (4), the initial dilution of plume material, after the 
plume has reached its final height, is calculated as follows: 

2.94 Q
X=--.:.. (6) 

(Ah)2u 

where Q is the emission rate. 

Thus, plume material is assumed to be at least as dilute as that shown by Equation (6). 
For emissions sources having more than one stack, it is assumed that there is an overlap of 
plumes from individual stacks. For cases in which the initial dilution during plume rise is 

7 



greater than the standard Gaussian formula would predict at the downwind distance of final 
plume rise, a virtual point-source offset is introduced so that dilution at this distance is at 
least as much as that shown in Equation (6). 

Plume Rise 

The final plume rise in PLUVUE II is calculated using the modified plume rise formulas 
of Briggs (1969, 1971, 1972) defined as follows: 

For unstable or neutral atmospheric conditions, the downwind distance of final plume rise is 
Xr = 3.5 x*, where 

(7) 
The final plume rise under these conditions is 

(8) 
For stable atmospheric conditions, the downwind distance of final plume rise is Xr =1t u s"112 , 
where the stability parameter s is defined as follows: 

s = g -~.....:6/;..__~~z: (9) 

T 

where g is the gravitational acceleration, 88/Bz is the potential temperature gradient, and T is 

the temperature. 

The plume rise for stable atmospheric conditions is 

113 

Ah = minimum of { 2•6(Ff(us)) (10)

S pl/4s-3/8 

The buoyancy flux (F) in the above equations is calculated on the basis of the flue gas 
volumetric flow rate per stack (V'), flue gas and ambient temperature in degrees Kelvin (Tstack• 
TambienJ• and gravitational acceleration, as follows: 

F = gV'(l-TQlri}Mnt) (11) 
x T$111Ck 

8 



Gaussian Plume Diffusion 

After the plume has achieved its final height (about 1 km downwind), plume 
concentrations for uniform wind fields can be adequately predicted using a Gaussian model if 
the wind speed u at plume height H (or h5 +~h. where h5 is the stack height) and the rate of 
diffusion are known for the particular situation so that diffusion coefficients (cry, crz) can be 
selected: 

22

X= Q exp [ _ !(i..J2 
]{ exp [ _ !(H +zl ]+ exp [ _ !(H -zl ] } (12)

2rtaazu 2 a2 az 2 az

11 

Equation (12) is appropriate for a conservative species and can be modified to be appropriate 
for a nonconservative species by changing the source term Q. 

It is necessary for calculating plume visual impact to integrate, along the line of sight, 
the plume extinction coefficient, the magnitude of which depends on primary and secondary 
particulate and nitrogen dioxide concentrations. Equation (12) can be integrated (Ensor et al., 
1973) in the cross-wind direction y, from y =-oo toy =+oo, to obtain the optical thickness of 
the plume: 


where be"' is the incremental increase in extinction coefficient in the plume and Q' is the flux 
of the plume extinction coefficient over the entire plume cross section at downwind distance 

x. In the vertical direction z, from z =0 to z =+oo, the plume optical thickness is

Observer-Plume Orientation 

The magnitude of the visual impact of a plume depends on the orientation of the 
observer with respect to the plume because the plume optical thickness will vary depending 
on this orientation. Figure 1 shows plan and elevation views of an observer and a plume and 
indicates that the sight path distance through the constituents of the plume ·is a function of 
angles a and ~. The optical thickness for most combinations of angles a and ~ can be 
approximated as follows:

(15) 
Figure 1 suggests that plume optical thickness is greater for horizontal sight paths than 
vertical ones, particularly during stable conditions when the plume cross section is flattened. 

Limited Mixing 

When vertical diffusion is limited by a stable capping layer, Equation (12) is no longer 
valid, and a Gaussian formulation, with terms for reflection from the top of the mixed layer 
(at altitude IluJ, is used. Let H' be the height of the virtual source positioned above the top 
of the mixed layer: H' = 2 ~-H . 

The Gaussian formulation for limited mixing is 

X = + 
(16) 
In this instance of limited mixing, the plume material eventually becomes uniformly mixed in 
the vertical direction for 0 < z < ~· In the limit, the concentration is expressed as follows: 

2 

x= exp __ _]_ (17)

Q [ 1 ( ]]

(21C) 1fla.,uHm 2 a., 
The calculation of plume optical thickness in the y-direction becomes simply 


(18) 
Surface Deposition 

Surface deposition is calculated by integrating the plume concentrations at the ground 
and multiplying by a deposition velocity, Vd, that characterizes gas and particulate surface 
depletion: 

11 



(19) 
Since nocturnal ground-based stable layers shield a plume from the ground at night, 
surface deposition is effectively zero at night. This is handled in the model using a flag 
keyed to the time of day at which the plume parcel is at a given downwind distance. 

Power Law Wind Profile Extrapolation of Surface Winds 

PLUVUE II is designed to use either wind speed aloft or surface wind speed (commonly 
measured at 10 m above the surface). The power law extrapolation presented in the User's 
Manual for a Single-Source (CRSTER) Model (EPA, 1977) is used. The surface wind speed 
is extrapolated to stack height for the plume rise calculation, and the surface wind speed is 
extrapolated to the final plume height for Gaussian concentration calculations·. The power 
law extrapolation is as follows: 

(20)
u = u0(z/10)l' 

where u =wind speed at altitude z (ms-1) and llo = surface wind speed (ms-1). The profile

2.1.2 Atmospheric Chemistry 
The conversion of emission of nitric oxide (NO) and sulfur dioxide (SOJ to nitrogen 
dioxide (N02) gas and sulfate (S04) aerosol, species responsible for visual effects, must be 
calculated in the visibility model. 

• 

This is not consistent with current EPA regulatory models. The PLUVUE II algorithm 
was not modified because of the potential effect on the model performance. 

12 



The rate of chemical conversion of these primary emissions to secondary species 
responsible for visual impact is dependent on the concentration of the reacting species and 
ultraviolet (UV) solar flux. Thus, conversion rates are dependent on both plume dilution and 
time of day. A plume parcel at a given downwind distance has a specific gas, time of 
emission, and history of UV irradiation, which can affect the amount of N02 and S04 in the 
plume at a given time. Thus, the chemical conversion in each plume parcel must be treated 
separately, taking into account these factors. 

PLUVUE II is· structured to take a "snapshot" of a plume at a given time. In PLUVUE 
II, the chemical conversion is calculated for each plume parcel, observed at a given distance, 
in a Lagrangian manner; i.e., the reaction rates are calculated at each of several discrete 
downwind distances and times from the point of emission to the downwind distance at which 
the plume parcel is observed. Thus, the age of a plume parcel observed at downwind 
distance "obs is X0 bju, where u is the wind speed. The time (t) at which a plume parcel is at a 
given downwind distance (x) related to the time of observation (tobs) is as follows: 

xobs -x 

(21)
t=t ---


ob& U 

The UV flux is calculated as a function of time that a plume parcel is at a given 
downwind distance x from the solar zenith angle (i.e., the angle between direct solar rays and 
the normal to the earth's surface). The zenith angle is calculated on the basis of the latitude, 
longitude, date, and time using a subroutine developed by Schere and Demerjian (1977). 

The rate of chemical conversion is also dependent on the location of the plume parcel 
within the plume. PLUVUE II makes calculations at the following altitudes within the plume 
(y = 0): at the plume centerline (z = H) and at z = H ± n O'z, where n = 1 and 2. 

Conversion of NO to N02 

Nitrogen dioxide gas can cause a yellow-brown discoloration of the atmosphere. 
Although some discoloration is a result of wavelength-dependent light scattering caused by 
submicron aerosol, the dominant colorant of power plant plumes is N02, which causes a 
yellow-brown discoloration that may be apparent at significant distances downwind of large 
coal-fired power plant~, particularly in areas where the background visual range is excellent. 

Very little N02 is emitted directly from combustion sources. However, colorless nitric 
oxide is formed by the _thermal oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen at the high temperatures 
experienced in the combustion zone (the boiler in a power plant) and the oxidation of 
nitrogen that may be present in the fuel. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere can form 
sufficient N02 from NO to cause atmospheric discoloration. Available measurements of NO 

13 



and N02 concentrations in power plant plumes in non-urban areas sug.gest that the conversion 
of NO to N02 can be calculated from a simple set of three reactions.* 

The first of these is the thermal oxidation of NO to N02: 

2NO + ~ 2N02 
(22)

0 2 

The reaction is termolecular, but bimolecular with respect to NO; it is therefore very fast at 
high concentrations of NO .but slow at the lower concentrations that exist in the atmosphere 
or in a plume. The reaction rate for Equation (22), based on Baulch et al. (1973) is 

(23)
d[N:2] ~ [ 4.015 x 10-12 exp ( ~:~)] [N0]2[0.J (tn ppmjs) 

where R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. 

The reaction with ozone also affects the conversion of NO to N02: 

K, 

(24) 
NO 
+ -N02 :t


0 3 0 2 

The reaction is fast, with a rate (Leighton, 1961; Davis et al., 1974; Niki, 1974) at 25°C of 

d[N02] = 0.44 [N0][0] (in ppm/s) 
(25)

3

dt 

This reaction time accounts for the ozone depletion measured within power plant plumes and 
is important because ozone concentrations can be high even in nonurban regions. Measured 
ozone concentrations in nonurban areas of the western United States range from 0.02 to 

0.08 ppm. 
Whereas the thermal oxidation rate in the reaction shown in Equation (23) decreases as 
the plume mixes (because the NO concentration decreases), the formation of nitrogen dioxide 
via Equation (24) is enhanced as the plume mixes because additional ozone from the 
atmosphere is mixed into the plume, allowing Equation (24) to proceed. When there are no 
reactions converting N02 to NO (e.g., at night), Equation (24) proceeds until all of the NO in 
the plume is converted to N02 or until the ozone concentration in the plume drops to zero. 
Therefore, the rate of conversion of NO to N02 via Equation (24) is limited by the rate of the 
plume mixing that provides the necessary atmospheric ozone. 

* 
In urban areas, a complete photochemical mechanism should be applied to calculate N02 
concentrations. Also, it should be noted that N02 is destroyed by reaction with the 
hydroxyl radical (OH·), as discussed in the next subsection. 
14 



To complete the set of chemical reaction mechanisms, we must consider the photolysis 
of N02• When sunlight illuminates a plume containing nitrogen dioxide, short wavelength 
light and ultraviolet radiation are absorbed by the N02• As noted above, absorption of the 
shorter wavelength light produces the characteristic yellow-brown color associated with N02• 
Absorption of the more energetic ultraviolet light (UV) results in dissociation of the N02 
molecule:

where Kd depends on the amount of light incident on the nitrogen dioxide. Davis et al.

With this set of chemical reactions, the chemical conversion of NO to N02 in the 
atmosphere can be calculated from background pollutant concentrations and from plume NOx 
increments using the technique suggested by Latimer and Samuelsen (1975) and White 
(1977). Making the steady-state approximation, we have 

(30) 
where 

(31) 
and 

(32) 
[NO:z], signifies the concentration of N02 formed via the termolecular reaction presented in 
Equation (22) and [NO:Jb signifies background concentrations. Substituting Equations (31) 
and (32) into Equation (30) we can solve for the concentration of N02 using the standard 

quadratic equation in the form of (y = (-b ± Vb2 -4ac ) 12a) where y = [NOJ. The positive 
root of the quadratic was found to be physically unreasonable; therefore, the quadratic was 
solved using the negative root as follows: 

15 



Conversion of S02 to S04 = 

It is critical to calculate the conversion of S02 emissions to sulfate (S04=) aerosol, 
because the latter can effectively scatter light and cause reductions in visual range. The usual 
approach is to assume that sulfur dioxide (S02) gas is convened to sulfate (S04=) aerosol at 
some constant rate; this approach employs a user-input value of a pseudo-first-order rate 
constant whose value is empirically determined. 

There is considerable variation, however, in such measured S02-to-S04 = conversion rates, 
which range from a few tenths of a percent to several percent per hour. Much of this 
variance in S02-to-S04 =conversion observed in the field measurement programs in recent 
years can be explained using a model that accounts for the reactions of plume S02 and N02 
with the hydroxyl (OH·) radical. This chemical mechanism is incorporated in PLUVUE II. 
In clean background areas, the gas-phase oxidation of S02 and N02 to sulfate aerosol and 
nitrate (nitric acid vapor) is due primarily to the reaction of these species with OH·. Previous 
assessments of homogeneous (gas-phase) oxidation of S02 to sulfate estimated the proportion 
assignable to the reaction with hydroxyl between about 75 percent in clean atmospheres 
(Calvert et al., 1978; Altshuller, 1979) and as low as 40 percent in polluted urban air (Isaksen 
et al., 1978), but more recent estimates place these values much higher. Kinetic models 
forming the basis of the early estimates used the value of 1.3 x ·10-12 cm3mol"1s·1 for the rate 
constant of reaction for H02 and CH30 2 with NO. More recently, however, this rate has been 
measured at 8.1 x 10"12 cm3mol"1s·1 (Hampson and Garvin, 1978). This larger rate constant 
lowers the expected concentration of these peroxy radicals by a factor of 6 and, in turn, 
greatly reduces the S02 conversion resulting from reactions with these radicals. When 
recalculated using the new rate constant, the fraction of S02-to-sulfate conversion that results 
from reaction with the hydroxyl radical is approximately 95 percent for clean atmospheres 
and 70 percent for the extremely polluted case. 

These estimates are supported by the work of Miller (1978), who found that the S02 
oxidation rate was not dependent on the absolute concentrations of hydrocarbons and nitrogen 
oxides but on the ratio of nonmethane hydrocarbon to nitrogen oxides. 

The rate of sulfate (and nitric acid) formation can be estimated by calculating the steadystate 
concentration of OH· within a plume. This steady-state plume OH· concentration is 
calculated by balancing the rate of OH· production with the rate of OH· destruction. 

16 


With the assumption of ste-ady-state concentrations of O('D) and OH· in the plume, 
plume pseudo-first-order S02-to-S04 and N02-to-HN03 conversion rates can be calculated as 
follows:* 

d[S02] 

---1 = K37[0H·] 
(34) 

[S02] dt 

1 
d[N02] 

= K38[0H·] · , 
(35) 

[N02] dt 


Plume OH· concentrations are reduced below background tropospheric values for two 
reasons: 

Plume ozone (03) concentrations are reduced below background values because of the 
reaction NO + 0 3 ~ N02 + 0 2 (Eq. 24). 

Plume concentration of N02 and S02 are high, thus reducing steady-state OH· 
concentrations. 

It should be pointed out that at night there is no production of OH· from ozone photolysis; 
also, in early morning and later afternoon and in winter, OH· production is diminished 
because ultraviolet flux decreases as solar zenith angles approach 90°. Thus, sulfate and 
nitrate are not formed at night and are formed only very slowly in concentrated plumes. 
Nitrate is expected to remain as HN03 vapor and without visual effects uqtil it is eventually 
deposited. Ammonium nitrate could exist in aerosol form; however, sulfate competes for 
available atmospheric ammonia. 

2.1.3 Aerosol Size Distribution 
The aerosol size distribution is characterized by a series of aerosol modes, each having a 
log-normal distribution of mass (or volume). Each of the following modes is treated 
separately in PLUVUE II: 

* 
The user is given the option in PLUVUE IT of supplementing the S02-to-S04 = conversion 
rate calculated on the basis of steady-state plume OH· concentrations with a user-input 
pseudo-first-order rate constant, which 1Can be varied as a function of downwind distance. 
17 



· 
Background accumulation mode (submicron) aerosol (typically having a mass median 
diameter of about 0.3 pm and a geometric standard deviation of 2). 

Background coarse mode (> 1 pm) aerosol (typically having a mass median diameter 
of about 6 pm and a geometric standard deviation of 2). 

Background carbonaceous aerosol (typically having a mass median diameter of about 

0.1 pm and a geometric standard deviation of 2). 
Plume primary particulate aerosol (e.g., fly ash emissions). 
Plume secondary sulfate (S04=) aerosol (typically having a mass median diameter of 
0.1 to 0.3 pm and a geometric standard deviation of 2). 
Plume carbonaceous aerosol (typically having a mass median diameter of 0.1 pm and a 
geometric standard deviation of 2). 

The expression developed by Winkler (1973) is used to calculate the amount of liquid 
water associated with submicron background .and plume sulfate aerosol as a function of 
relative humidity. 

Secondary aerosol is assumed to form in the submicron plume secondary aerosol mode. 
A time delay equal to the time between successive downwind distances is introduced to 
account for coagulation and condensation time delays. 

2.1.4 Atmospheric Optics 
. In the atmospheric optics component of the plume visibility model, the light scattering 
and absorption properties of the aerosol and the resultant light intensity (spectral radiance) for 
various illumination and viewing situations are computed. 

Calculation of the Scattering and Absorption Properties 

After the concentrations of the pollutants are specified by the transport and chemistry 
subroutines, their radiative properties must be determined. For N02, the absorption at a 
particular wavelength is a tabulated function (Nixon, 1940) multiplied by the concentration. 
For aerosols, however, the procedure is more complicated. 

In general, a particle's ability to scatter and absorb radiation at a particular frequency is 
a function of size, composition, shape, and relative humidity. The flexibility to specify the 
size distribution of both primary and secondary particles was desired. Therefore, the effect of 
particle size on the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient and the phase 

18 



function, the solution of Maxwell's equations for scattering by a sphere, and the so-called Mie 
equations were used in PLUVUE ll. These calculations are appropriate for atmospheric 
aerosol; comparisons of Mie calculations, with empirical correlations of scattering-to-mass, 
indicate substantial agreement. The Mie calculations are input to the PLUVUE II model 
using the MIETBL algorithm which is discussed in detail in Section 2.3. 

Calculation of Light Intensity 

The light intensity, or radiance (watts/m2/steradian) at a particular location in the 
atmosphere is a function of the direction of observation n and the wavelength A.. Calculation 
of the light intensity in a medium follows from the radiative transfer equation. This equation 
is a conservation of energy statement that accounts for the light added to the line of sight by 
scattering and the light lost because of absorption and scattering. Approximations and 
solution techniques applicable to planetary atmospheres have been discussed by Hansen and 
Travis (1974) and Irvine (1975). 

To compute the spectral light intensity at the observer, we sum (integrate) the scattered 
and absorbed light over the path, r, associated with the line of sight n. The resultant general 
expression for the background sky intensity at a particular wavelength is 

Ib(C) = 
-;•J ~~) J I(C1,t') p(C1 
... C,t') d01 e -'C' dt1 , (36) 
0 D1-4n 

where 
't = the optical depth ('t =Jor bext dr, where bext is the extinction coefficient), 


(l) = the albedo for single scattering ( ro =bscalbext where bscat is the scattering 
coefficient), 
p(O'--+ Q) = the scattering distribution function for the angle Q' --7 Q, and 
I = the spectral intensity at t' from direct and diffuse solar radiation. 

The intensity seen by an observer in direction Q of a background viewing object of 
intensity Io at distance R is

Equations (36) and (37) then completely describe the spectral intensity of the sky and a 
background object. Once these two quantities are known, the visual effects of the intervening 
atmosphere can be quantified. In evaluating Equations (36) and (37), we encounter two main 

19 



difficulties: first, the quantity in the integral is a fairly complicated function, and accurate 
specification is tedious. Second, the atmosphere is inherently inhomogeneous; thus, the 
radiative properties of w and p are somewhat complicated functions of r and !l. The · 
following approximations are therefore made in PLUVUE II: 

Plane parallel atmosphere 

Two homogeneous layers 

Average solar flux approximation

The radiance impinging on the top of the planetary boundary layer, l's~ty(!l), is calculated 
from average properties of the upper atmospheric layer:

where ro.. and P(95) are average albedo and phase functions, respectively, and 'tL is the optical 
depth of the planetary boundary layer. The atmosphere is then assumed to be composed of 
two layers of homogeneous properties, i.e., an upper atmospheric layer and a planetary 
boundary layer. 

In Equation (38), the first term represents the light that travels directly from the object to 
the observer, the second term is integrated along the line of sight and represents the light that 
has been scattered once from the sunlight's angle of incidence into the line of sight (singlescattering 
term), and the third term represents the light that has been scattered at least once 
before being scattered into the line of sight (multiple-scattering term). 

The ftrst term is calculated from the values of the background object radiance or sky 
radiance at the top of the boundary layer and extinction coefficient. The background object 
radiance, l0 (!l), is calculated from the optical depth and from the molecular and aerosol 
scattering phase functions. Since the sky radiance, l's~ty(!l) is given by Equation (39), it 
depends on the aerosol concentration, the size distributions, and the scattering angle. 

20 



For the second term, one assumes spatially averaged albedo 0> and phase functions P(85) 
for the planetary boundary layer. Equation (37) may be rewritten as follows: 

(40) 
where es is the single-scattering angle and G(O,'tR) is the multiple-scattering term. The 
second term is calculated from the values of the extinction coefficient along the line of sight. 
Similarly, Equation (38) is rewritten as follows:

The radiance of a plume with a background object is calculated in three steps, as shown 
schematically in Figure 2. First, the background radiance incident on the plume, I1(0), is 
calculated according to Equation (42): 

(42)
' . 

where 't1 is the optical depth between the background object and the observer. 

The radiance leaving the plume, IiO), is calculated from 11(0) and the scattering and 
absorption of light in the plume:

13 
0 


where 'tP is the optical depth of the plume along the line of sight, and roP is the plume albedo. 
These variables are calculated from the plume gas and particle scattering and absorption 
coefficients. The integration of these coefficients is carried out by assuming that 
the plume is Gaussian (Latimer and Samuelsen, 1978). 


The plume radiance at the observer location, ~(0), is then calculated from I2(Q) 
according to Equation (44):

(44) 
where 't2 is the optical depth between the plume and the observer. 

The contrast of the plume can then be calculated from the plume and background 
radiances as follows: 

c = IP(O) -lobi(O) 

(45) 
[obj(O) 

In calculating the radiances, the multiple-scattering term requires the integration of the 
angle-dependent sky radiance over all angles and over the optical depth. The calculation is 
performed in two steps that are summarized as follows. 

First, the scattered intensity source function is calculated according to the algorithm of 
Isaacs (1981). The formulation is based on a two-stream approximation to the radiative 
transfer equation and employs the Rayleigh and Henyey-Greenstein phase functions for 
molecular and aerosol scattering, respectively. The phase functions are calculated according 
to Mie theory. Then, the multiple-scattering term is calculated by integrating over Q' .and t'. 
This approach allows an anisotropic description of the multiple-scattering term that is 
computationally reasonable. 

Thus, the background intensity and the intensity in the direction of an object at distance 
R from the observer can be computed given the following inputs: 

Background radiative properties (e.g., size distribution visual range), 
Solar zenith angle, 
Scattering angle, 
Viewed object intensity, 
Direction of observation, and 
Planetary boundary layer height. 


The plume is treated as a homogeneous layer with a given optical thickness and mean 
properties wplume and Pplume(8). It is also assumed that the plume does not affect the solar 
radiation illumination (an optically thin plume). 

Spectral radiance, or light intensity I(A.), is calculated for 39 wavelengths spanning the 
visible spectrum (0.36 pm <A.< 0.74 pm, in 0.01 pm increments).

2.1.5 Geometry of Plume, Observer, and Sun 
For performing as many as four different types of optics calculations at selected points 
along the plume trajectory, PLUVUE has two modes: plume-based and observer-based 
calculations. The calculations for plume transport, diffusion, and chemistry are identical for 
calculations in both modes. The major difference between the two types of calculations is the 
orientation of the position of the viewer to the source and the plume. 

Plume-based calculations are repeated for several combinations of plume-observer-sun 
geometries. Because of the repetitions, these plume-based calculations are more time 
consuming and produce more printed output than the observer-based calculations, which are 
performed for only the specific line-of-sight orientations corresponding to the given observer 
position, the portions of the plume being observed, and the specific position of the sun 
relative to these lines of sight. 

There are four types of optics calculations: (1) horizontal views through the plume with 
a sky viewing background; (2) nonhorizontal views through the plume with a sky viewing 
background; (3) horizontal views through the plume with white, gray, and black viewing 
backgrounds; and (4) horizontal views along the axis of the plume with a sky viewing 
background. 

Figure 3 illustrates the geometry of the plume-based optics calculations of horizontal 
views through the plume. This figure depicts schematically the variecy of distances from the 
observer to the plume and the variety of horizontal azimuthal angles between the line of sight 
and the plume trajectory.* Calculations for all these geometries are repeated for up to six 
different scattering angles. 

Figure 4 shows the geometry for the optics calculation for horizontal views perpendicular 
to the plume with white, gray, and black viewing backgrounds. For each point on the plume 
trajectory and each scattering angle, the calculations are executed for a range of distances 
from the observer to the background object, starting at the plume centerline and ending at 80 
percent of the background visual range. The distances, from the observer to the plume, range 
from 2 percent to 80 percent of the background visual range. 

Figure 5 illustrates the configuration used for the plume-based calculation for views 
along the axis of the plume. The calculations are made from the second through the final 
downwind distances. · At each point, the observer is looking toward the emissions source with 
a sky background. The calculations are made for views through plume segments defmed by 
the particular point of analysis, as well as successive analysis points upwind. The 

• 

These azimuthal angles are measured from the plume centerline to the line of sight such 
that the angles range from 0° to 90°.

calculations are repeated for observer positions at a range of distances from the downwind 
point at which the plume segment is assumed to end. 

The observer-based geometry used for views through the plume center with a clear sky 
background is shown in Figure 6. At each point of analysis along the plume trajectory, the 
optics calculation is made for only one scattering angle, one plume-observer distance, and one 
azimuthal angle specific for the source position, observer position, wind direction, date, and 
time of day used as input. For calculations with white, gray, and black viewing 
backgrounds, the geometries are the same as those for horizontal views with a sky 
background (Figure 7), with the addition of the specific background object distance, along 
each line of sight, from the observer through the points on the plume trajectory. 

Figure 7 is a plan view of the geometry for an observer-based calculation for views 
along the plume. At each analysis point along the plume trajectory, the centerline 
concentration is integrated along a segment on the line of sight that would correspond to a 
Gaussian distribution. The line of sight is always horizontal. The calculation is performed 
for a clear sky background and for white, gray, and black viewing objects at the specific 
distance for each line of sight. 

It should be noted that if the distance (rp) and azimuthal angle (a) are such that the 
observer is within the plume, the total plume optical thickness along the line of sight is 
reduced accordingly. _The calculated distance rP is the distance between the observer and tht~ 
centroid of plume material viewed by the observer. 

2.1.6 Quantifying Visibility Impairment 
Visibility impairment may be quantified once the spectral light intensity or radiance l(A,) 
has been calculated for the specific lines of sight of an observer at a given location in an 
atmosphere with known aerosol and pollutant concentrations. Visibility impairment-including 
reduction in visual range, the perceptibility of plumes and haze layers, and 
atmospheric discoloration--is caused by changes in light intensity as a result of light scattering 
and absorption in the atmosphere. 

Some parameters which may be used to characterize the visibility effects of the plume 
are listed: 

Visual Range Reduction 

This parameter is the percentage reduction in visual range (the farthest distance one 
can see a large, black object) caused by the plume material. This parameter can be 
interpreted to indicate the haziness or loss of contrast of viewed landscape features 
caused by plume material.

Plume Contrast 

This parameter is the relative brightness of a plume compar~d to a viewing 
background. A contrast that is positive indicates a relatively bright plume and a 
negative contrast indicates a dark plume. Contrasts with absolute values greater than 

0.02 are generally perceptible. A two percent contrast is used to define visual range. 
Plume contrast calculations in PLUVUE II are done at one wavelength, 0.55 Jlm, 
which is a green color in the middle of the visible spectrum, which extends from 0.4 
pm (blue) to 0.7 pm (red). 
Blue-Red Ratio 

This parameter indicates the relative coloration of a plume relative to its viewing 
background. Blue-red ratios less than one indicate relatively yellow, red, or brown 
plumes. Blue-red ratios greater than one indicate plumes that are whiter, grayer, or 
bluer than the viewing background. Blue-red ratios less than 0.9 or greater than 1.1 
would be indicative of perceptible plumes. 

Color Contrast Parameter (LlE) 

The color contrast parameter or LlE is probably the best single indicator of the 
perceptibility of a plume due both to its contrast and its color with respect to a 
viewing background. LlE is calculated for the entire visible spectrum and indicates 
how different the brightness and color of plume and background are. The larger the 
value of LlE, the greater the perceptibility of the plume. Under ideal viewing 
conditions, when the viewing background is uniform and the plume is sharp-edged, a 
just perceptible LlE would be one; for cases of plumes with diffuse edges, a just 
perceptible LlE threshold would be greater than one, perhaps two (EPA, 1988). 

2.1.7 Code Modifications 
In 1989 (SAl, 1989), the PLUVUE II model was revised to include an interpolated 
scheme to calculate the phase functions which significantly decreased the execution time of 
the PLUVUE II computer code. The development of an interpolative scheme to calculate 
phase functions needed in the visibility model was performed by Richards and Hammarstrand 
(1988). The phase function calculation uses "lookup" tables which contain the phase 
functions for different particle size dfstributions. Further details concerning the phase 
function calculations are given in Section 2.3. 

Details concerning the most recent modifications to the PLUVUE II ·algorithm are as 
follows: 

31 



Under Pasquill-Gifford stability class A conditions, PLUVUE II was found to produce 
numerical overflows. Diagnostic checks indicated that the interpolation formula based 
on a series of logarithms to calculate cry and crz ~n PLUVUE II have a ~latively large 
degree of error (especially for values of O'z). In order to avoid the numerical 
overflows caused by the logarithmic equations, the subroutines used to calculate cry 
and O'z in ISC2 (EPA, 1992) were substituted for the original PLUVUE II subroutines. 

The optical depth (called TAUP3) in subroutine PLMOBJ becomes negative and 
produces light amplification rather than attenuation along a line of sight when the 
observer and the object lies close to the plum~. Initially PLUVUE II insures· that the 
plume lies in the foreground of an object for the case where the azimuthal angle for 
the plume line of sight is 90°. However, this check was not conducted by PLUVUE II 
for angles other than 90° when the plume moves away from the observer and the 
distance to the object remains the same. As a result, the plume-observer distance (RP) 
exceeded the observer-object distance (RO). When this occurs, a negative optical 
depth (TAUP3) is estimated, which in turns results in light being amplified along the 
line of sight rather than being attenuated. Code has been added to PLUVUE II to 
check if RO is less than RP. If this occurs, then the following message is printed 
"You have placed the plume behind the background -stopped processing" and the 
program stops. 

When the scattering angle approaches the solar zenith angle near 45°, a PLUVUE II 

code check to avoid an inverse cosine argument outside the range (-1, 1) terminated 

many of the optical computations. Due to the conversion from radians to degrees plus 

other numerical manipulations, the distance calculations produce slight numerical 

arguments greater than 1.0 to the inverse cosine function. The numerical excesses 

were found to be of the order of less than one percent (-1.01, 1.01). As a result, for 

excesses less than two percent (1.000000 to 1.020000), the argument is now truncated 

to 1.00000 so that the estimates continue to be made. For excesses greater than two 

percent, should they occur, the optical estimations are stopped. 

The stability class supplied for intermediate distances seemed to be ignored by 

PLUVUE II. It was decided that the ability to change stability class with downwind 

distance should not be allowed; therefore, the option was disabled in PLUVUE II by 

setting NXSTAB to NX2+1 and INEW to I. NXSTAB (the index for downwind 

distance where stability changes from I (stability index) to INEW (secondary stability 

index)) and INEW are no longer input to PLUVUE II. 

The PLUVUE II model incorrectly predicted impacts for lines of sight with terrain 

background. It was discovered that there were errors in the PLUVUE IT model when 

calculating the effects of multiple scattering because two of the three multiple 

scattering integral terms were missing from the algorithm. The corrected integral 

terms have been incorporated in the revised version of PLUVUE IT. 

32 


In addition to the code modifications listed above, a number of cosmetic changes have 
been made to the code. Headers have been added to all subroutines. Unused variables and 
arrays, along with commented out statements, have been eliminated. 

2.1.8 Input Data 
The input data needed to run PLUVUE II are contained in one file of 80 byte, cardimage 
records. As is discussed in Sections 2.2 and 3.2, the RUNPLUVU visibility modeling 
system allows the user to interactively edit the PLUVUE II input file. The PLUVUE II input 
data include the following parameters:

The input data file also has numerous switches or flags to allow the user to select the 
particular subset of the complete model that is required. Table 1 lists the input parameters 
with formats, summary descriptions, and suggested values for some of the input parameters.

Some of the options listed in Table 1 are further described below: 

The parameter IUSFC is simply a flag to allow the wind speed to be input at the 
effective stack height (IUSFC =0) or at the common 10-m instrument height (IUSFC = 1). 

IFLG1 is a flag that allows the user to select or skip the calculation of visibility 
impairment of the plume for horizontal views with a clear sky background. IFLG2 allows the 
user to select or skip the calculation of visibility impairment for nonhorizontal views and 
clear sky background. IFLG3 allows the user to select or skip the calculation of visibility 
impairment calculations of the plume as seen in front of white, gray, and black backgrounds. 
IFLG4 allows the user to select or skip the visibility impairment calculation for an observer 
looking straight down the centerline of various segments of the plume or for an observer 
looking across the plume at a small acute angle to the plume centerline. For all of these, a 
value of 1 executes the calculations and a value of 0 branches around them. 

NZF is a switch that indicates whether the visibility impairment calculations will be 
made for the plume centerline altitude only (NZF = 1) or for both the plume centerline and 
ground level (NZF =2). 

IDILU is a switch that controls the printing of the table of initial plume rise data. If 
IDILU =0, the table is not printed, and if IDILU = 1, it is printed. 

INTYP is a switch that allows the user to calculate the background visual range (INTYP 
=1) from user-input background coarse mode a~rosol concentrations and background sulfate: 
and nitrate concentrations. If INTYP :;: 1, the user inputs the background visual range and the 
background coarse mode aerosol concentration, and the model computes the background 
accumulation mode aerosol concentration that would be needed to cause the given visual 
range. 

ICON is a switch that allows the user to select the conversion rate of S02 to S04=, in 
addition to the rate calculated by the OH· model, as a constant with distance from the sourc~: 
(ICON =0) or as a separate value for each point of analysis downwind from the source 
(ICON = 1). These conversion rates are in units of percent per hour. RS02C gives the 
constant conversion rate for all points on the plume trajectory, while RS02 gives the 
downwind-distance-dependent conversion rates for each point of analysis. 

The parameters NC1 and NC2 are used to control whether the visibility impairment 
calculations are done for a plume-based scheme, an observer-based scheme, or both. NC1 set 
to 1 executes the plume-based calculations and NC2 set to 2 calculates the observer-based 
calculations. If NC1 is set to 1 and NC2 is set ro 2, both types of calculations will be made. 
If NC1 is set to 1 and NC2 is set to 1, only the plume-based calculations will be made. 
Finally, if NC1 is set to 2 and NC2 is set to 2, only the observer-based calculations will be 
made. 

42 



The stability index I specifies the stability category for the plume dispersion parameters: 
I = 1 for stability A, I =2 for stability B, I = 3 for stability C, etc. 

NT1 and NT2 assign the starting and ending indices for the scattering angle array used 
for the plume-based visibility impairment calculations. With NT1 =1 and NT2 =7, the 
default scattering angles (22°, 45°, goo, 135°, 158°, and 180°) are used. These angles are 
taken from the array TT, which has 0°, 22°, 45°, goo, 135°, 158°, and 180° as its first seven 
elements. NTl is one less than the actual starting index of TT, while NT2 corresponds to the 
actual ending index of TT. For a run with calculations for goo only, set NT1 to 3 and NT2 to 

4. For a run with calculations for goo 135°, 158°, and 180°, set NT1 to 3 and NT2 to 7. 
The index NX2 defines the number of points downwind along the plume trajectory 
where visibility impairment calculations will be made. The value of NX2 should be at least 
2, but not greater than 16. 

The array DIST specifies the distance downwind from the source along the plume 
trajectory of each point where visibility impairment calculations will be made. The units for 
this array are kilometers. For accurate preqiction of the oxidation of NOx to N02, it is 
important to use downwind distances that are close together and near the source. The first 
downwind distance must be 1 km; 2.5 km, 5 km, and 10 km are recommended for the 
succeeding three distances. The user is free to select the remaining points according to the 
needs of the situation. 

YINITL and ZINITL are used for area sources and define the initial lateral and vertical 
dimensions of the plume. For emissions from stacks, both YINITL and ZINITL should be set 
to zero. The units for these two variables are meters. 

When plume-based calculations are complete, a subset of the results must be selected for 
output to a binary file which may be used for further analysis such as plotting. The six 
indices listed on card A-3 determine the subset of results that will be written to the binary 
file. NPP selects the distance from the observer to the plume in the following manner:

2 0.05 
3 QlO

line of sight for a sky background:

NTP selects the scattering angle between the direct solar beam and the line of sight from the 
point of analysis to the observer. The value of NTP must be greater than or equal to NT1 
and less than or equal to (NT2-1). The values of NTP for each of the six scattering angles 

are shown below: ·

NZP selects the results for calculations of views through the center of the plume or views at 
·ground level across the plume trajectory. The values of NZP are limited by the value of NZF 

(card no. 8). If NZF = 1, the calculations are done only for views through the plume 
centerline,_ and NZP must be set to 3. If NZF =2, NZP may be set to 3 for values from 
calculations for views through the plume centerline, or NZP may be set to 6 for values from 

calculations for views at the surface through the plume trajectory. The index IPP selects the 

distance from the observer to the plume for plotting results of the calculations for views with 

white, gray, and black objects behind the plume. The values of IPP correspond to the 

distances shown below:

I01P is used to select the distance from the observer through the plume to the white, gray, 
and black background objects behind the plume. The value of I01P is limited by the value of 
IPP because the object background can be no farther than a distance equivalent to 80 percent 
of the background visual range from the observer. If IPP =1, the range of values of 101P is 
shown below:

When IPP =5, IOlP is limited to only two values:

2 0.80 
When IPP = 6, 10lP must be set to 1, which corresponds to a distance from the observer to 
the background object of 0.80 of the background visual range. These six indices do not place 
any restrictions on the calculations made by PLUVUE II, but they provide a means of 
selecting the desired subset of results to be saved for plotting. 

The UTM coordinates and elevations for observer and source locations and the UTM 
grid zone num~ers are taken from standard USGS maps. TZONE is the number of the time 
zone, with the Greenwich Meridian defined as 0. Values of TZONE are shown below:

The array TER gives the elevation of terrain at each point downwind for the visibility 
analysis. For the purpose of calculating plume-observer-sun geometry only, the plume 
centerline is assumed to rise above any terrain higher than the source elevation in order to 
maintain the same effective height above the terrain for all points downwind. If the terrain is 
flat or if it is desirable to maintain the same plume elevation at all points, use zero for all 
TER values. The model will then set all terrain elevations to the elevation of the source 
location. 

The ROBJT array allows the user to define the distances from the observer to the 
background terrain. These distances are read in for observer azimuths of from 15° to 360° in 

46 



15° increments. The distances are measured in kilometers by creating a terrain profile for 
each azimuth and determining the point at which the line of sight intersects the terrain. The 
observer-based calculations can be performed without measuring these values by setting all 
elements of the ROBJT array to zero. The background object distance will then be set to the 
observer-to-plume distance for each line of sight. WIND is the direction from which the 
wind is blowing, expressed in degrees. 

For user-defined values of plume dispersion parameters (IDIS =9), SY and SZ are read 
for each downwind distance. SY is the plume concentration horizontal standard deviation and 
SZ is the plume concentration vertical standard deviation in meters. 

2.2 PLUIN2 
The PLUIN2 computer algorithm (Richards and Hammarstrand, 1988) prepares data files 
of the format required for input to the revised PLUVUE II visibility model. PLUIN2 is 
designed to be "user friendly" and has the purpose of simplifying and speeding up the process 
of preparing input files to PLUVUE II. PLUIN2 is useful for both the user new to PLUVUE 
II, who desires assistance understanding the required inputs and does not wish to learn the 
details of the required data formats, as well as the experienced user who frequently prepares 
PLUVUE II input files and finds that PLUIN2 can shorten the time required for the work. 

PLUIN2 is executed within RUNPLUVU when the user wishes to modify an existing 
PLUVUE II input file. As is discussed in Section 3.2, the user must supply the name of an 
existing input data file. This file can be either one which was previously prepared and is to 
be modified, or the data file (TEST.INP) supplied with the RUNPLUVU system diskette. 
The user will be asked the filename which contains the revisions (the filename can be the 
same as the input filename) which will then automatically be used as the input file to 
PLUVUE II. While modifying a file using the PLUIN2 portion of RUNPLUVU, the user will 
be issued a series of prompts describing the information represented by each quantity in the 
input data file and its current value. If the current value is satisfactory, it can be accepted 
with a carriage return. If not, a new value may be entered. If only a few data values in the 
input file are to be changed, it is possible to branch to the location of the data to be changed, 
enter the new values, and then branch to the end of the PLUIN2 portion of RUNPLUVU. It 
is possible to branch to any input data at any time while modifying a data file, so it is easy to 
review and alter data. Further details concerning branching and the use of PLUIN2 within 
RUNPLUVU are given in Section 3.2.

2.3.1 Scattering Theory 
The following general discussion of scattering of solar radiation is primarily from 
Wallace and Hobbs (1977). The fraction of parallel beam radiation that is scattered when 
passing downward through a layer of infinitesimal thickness dz is described as 

dE,_

ds,_ !! -= K A sec cJ> ck (46) 

E,_ 

where K is a dimensionless coefficient, A is the cross-sectional area that the particles in a 
unit volume present to the beam of incident radiation, and cp is the zenith angle. If all the 
particles which the beam encounters in its passage through the differential layer were 
projected onto a plane perpendicular to the incident beam, the product A sec cp dz would 
represent the fractional area occupied by the particles. Thus, K plays the role of a scattering 
area coefficient which measures the ratio of the effective scattering cross section of the 
particles to their geometric cross section. On any given occasion a variety of particle shap1;,s 
and a whole spectrum of particle sizes are likely to be present simultaneously. For the 
idealized case of scattering by spherical particles of uniform radius r, the scattering coefficient 
K can be prescribed on the basis of theory. It is convenient to express K as a function of a 
dimensionless size parameter a = 2m/)..., which is a measure of the size of the particles in 
comparison to the wavelength of the incident radiation. Figure 8 shows a plot of a as a 
function of r and A.. 

The scattering area coefficient K depends not only upon the size parameter but also upon 
the index of refraction of the particles responsible for the scattering. Figure 9 shows K as a 
function of a for two widely differing refractive indices. 

Fo~ the special case of a<< 1 (the extreme left-hand side of Figure 9), Rayleigh showed 
that, for a given value of refractive index, K oc a4 and the scattered radiation is evenly divided 
between the forward and backward hemispheres. It can be seen from Figure 8 that the 
scattering of solar radiation by air molecules falls within this so-called Rayleigh scattering 
regime. 

When a is greater than about 50 (the value of the abscissa at the extreme right-hand side 
of Figure 9), K =2 and the angular distribution of scattered radiation can be described by the 
principles of geometric optics. 

For intermediate values of the size parameter between about 0.1 and SO, the scattering 
phenomenon must be described by Mie (e.g. Gustav Mie, a German physicist who carried out 
fundamental studies on the theory of electromagnetic scattering and kinetic theory). Within 
this so-called Mie regime, K exhibits the oscillatory behavior as shown in Figure 9. The 
angular distribution of scattered radiation is very complicated and varies rapidly with a,

with forward scattering predominating over back scattering. The scattering of sunlight by 
particles of haze, smoke, smog, and dust usually falls within the Mie regime. If the particles 
are rather uniform in size, the scattered sunlight may be either bluish or reddish in hue, 
depending upon whether BK/Ba is positive or negative a the wavelengths of visible light. 
Usually such particles exhibit a spectrum of sizes wide enough to span several maxima and 
minima in the plot of K(a), thus rendering the scattered light neutral or whitish in color. 

2.3.2 Mie Calculations 
There are only two quantities which need to be known about an isotropic, homogeneous 
sphere in order to calculate all of its light scattering properties: the relative index of 
refraction (m-ik), where m is the real and ik is the imaginary portion of the index of 
refraction, and the size parameter (a). The relative index of refraction is the index of 
refraction of the particle divided by the (real) index of refraction Il\, of the medium in which 
it is imbedded. Since the index of refraction of the particle may have a real part, which, for 
example, describes the bending of light at its surface, and an imaginary part, which describes 
the absorption, the relative index of refraction will, in general, be complex. It is possible for 
m to be less than unity; and when there is no absorption, k is equal to zero. 

The size parameter a is given by 

2 1t r 


(47)
a = = 

.t 

where r is the particle radius, A. is the wavelength of light in the medium, and A0 is the 
wavelength of light in a vacuum. 

Let 10 be the-irradiance of collimated light falling on the sphere (measured in units of 
energy per area), and I be the irradiance of scattered light measured in units at a large 
distance b from the sphere. In general, the directions of the incident and scattered light 
define a plane. If the incident light is plane polarized so that the electric vector is 
perpendicular to this plane, all of the scattered light will also be plane polarized with the 
electric vector perpendicular to the plane. The relation between the intensities is given by 

il

I=--I (48) 

r k2 b2 or 

where i1 is a dimensionless quantity calculated from the Mie equations, and k = 2rr().... Here 
the subscript r specifies the polarization, and is the last letter of perpendicular. The angle e 
through which the light has been scattered does not appear in Equation (48), but i1 is a 
functi9n of this angle. It is customary to choose 9 =0° for the unscattered beam, and 9 = 
180° for light which is scattered directly backwards. As mentioned earlier, i1 also depends on 
the relative refractive index and a, but on no other variables. · 

51 



If the incident light is polarized parallel with the plane, all of the scattered light is also 
polarized parallel, and a similar relation is written 

(49) 
where the subscript l is the last letter of parallel. If the incident light is unpolarized, then we 
may regard it as being made up of equal parts of the above two polarizations and obtain 

(50) 
Since i1 and i2 are in general not equal and the scattered light of the two polarizations 
have various phase differences, the scattered light is, in general, elliptically polarized. For 
most work, the three relations just given provide all the information on intensities and 
polarization that is desired. However, the MIETBL algorithm also calculates the phase 
difference 8 between the parallel and perpendicular scattered radiation, where 8 is positive if 
the parallel electric field lags the perpendicular field. Anyone interested in this phase 
difference should refer to page 36 of van de Hulst (1957). 

In general, four numbers are necessary and sufficient to specify the polarization of a 
beam of light, and the four Stokes parameters are convenient for this purpose. Chandrasekh.ar 
(1950) gives an excellent introduction to these parameters and their properties (see pages 24 
to 36), and it is recommended that anyone interested in more than unpolarized light should 
read these pages. 

The irradiance of the scattered light is strictly proportional to the intensity of the incident 
lighh Therefore, the total amount of energy scattered can be represented as a constant times 
the intensity of the incident light. This constant, which is called the scattering cross section, 
has the dimensions of area, and can be thought of as the area which would intercept a 
quantity of light equal to that which is scattered. 

Since Equation (50) gives the intensity of light scattered in any direction, it is possible to 
integrate it over all directions and find the total amount of light scattered, and hence the 
scattered cross section Csca· The result is 

52

A dimensionless quantity Qca can be obtained by dividing Qca by the cross section of the 
sphere 

(52) 
and this quantity is sometimes called an efficiency factor. In practice, the computer programs 
are always set up to calculate Qca directly. The quantities i1 and i2 are calculated separately if 
they are desired. 

In a similar way, we can define the absorption cross section Cabs as the total amount of 
light absorbed divided by the incident light irradiance, and the absorption efficiency is 

c. 
(53)
Qoln =


7t72 

The total amount of light both scattered and absorbed is given by the extinction cross section 

(54)
cur = cSCG + coln 

Also 

(55) 
The MIETBL alg~rithm calculates ~xt and Qca from the Mie equations, then evaluates <lbs 
by taking the difference. Therefore, in practice, it is possible for <lbs to have negative values 
about the size of the round off error of the computer. 

The book by Kerker (1969) gives an overview of light scattering by particles. 

2.3.3 Accuracy of the Interpolated Results of Mie Calculations 
One problem that had to be overcome to permit the separation of the Mie calculations 
from PLUVUE II is that the strength of the aerosol light scattering must be determined at 
each of the various scattering angles required by each of the sun-plume-observer geometries. 

53 



In MIETBL, the strength of the aerosol light scattering at the desired angles is determined by 
linear interpolation using data tabulated every 2°. 

To calculate the light scattering properties of a log-normal size distribution of aerosol . 
particles, it is necessary to perform Mie calculations for a number of different particle sizes: in 
the size range of interest. These results are then averaged using weighting factors derived 
from the relative numbers of particles of each size in the log-normal particle size distribution. 

For large particles, averaging over particle sizes is important because the angular 
distribution of light scattered by a single size of particles shows man-y peaks and valleys. 
When results for only a few sizes of particles are averaged, some of these peaks and valleys 
persist. However, when calculated results for many different particle sizes are weighted 
according to a log-normal distribution and averaged, the angular distribution of scattered light 
becomes quite smooth. 

The default aerosol properties for PLUVUE II which are contained in the Mie default 
library are listed in Table 2. The data were obtained from a listing of input parameters 
presented in an earlier version of the PLUVUE II User's Manual (Seigneu! et al., 198_3). 
These six aerosol size distributions provide a compact data set that may be used when no 
better aerosol size distribution data are available. When using this default library, the only 
choice to be made is aerosol diameter (D) = 0.2 pm for the plume secondary aerosol in 
polluted or humid areas (e.g., east of the Mississippi) or D = 0.1 pm in clean or dry areas 
(e.g., the clean areas in the west or Alaska). 

2.4 Comparison of Revised PLUVUE I~ with Original PLUVUE II 
A comparison of the original version of PLUVUE II with the revised version for 
different stability classes is presented in Table A-1 in the Appendix. The example used is the 
same as that provided with the original version of the PLUVUE II User's Manual. The 
calculations are made at a downwind distance of 9 km. Four different visibility parameters: 
visual range reduction, blue-red ratio, plume contrast, and dE are compared for six different 
stability classes (SC =A, B, C, D, E, and F). Four different backgrounds are examined: sky, 
white, gray, and black. As shown in Table A-1, the differences between the two versions of 
PLUVUE II are minimal and are primarily due to the changes in the methods for calculating 
crY and crz (see explanation in Section 2.1. 7). Due to numerical underflows associated with the 
calculation of crY and crz, the original version of the model did not run for a number of 
attempted tests.

3.0 USER INSTRUCTIONS 
This section describes the basic computer requirements which are necessary to use the 
RUNPLUVU system, detailed operating instructions, and a Level-3 plume visibility example. 

3.1 Computer Requirements 
The basic computer requirements for using the RUNPLUVU software are as follows: 

80386 or higher processor 

>1MB of RAM 

Hard Disk with sufficient storage space to handle the executable file, input data 

files, and output files (file sizes will vary depending on application) 
Math coprocessor (80 x 87 chip) 

The amount of memory available on any particular PC will depend on the machine 
configuration including the amount of memory used by the operating system, memory used by 
any special device drivers, and any utility programs resident in memory. The amount of 
memory needed to actually run the software will be somewhat larger than 1 MB because 
additional memory is needed for buffers when the program opens files. 

RUNPLUVU is compiled using Lahey F77L-EM/32 Version 5.0. This is the extended 
memory version for 32-bit ·computers. This will only run on 386 or higher PCs with more 
than 640K memory. 

3.2 Operating Instructions for RUNPLUVU 
In this section, shaded texr denotes what will appear on the computer screen during the 
RUNPLUVU session. All the data files on the RUNPLUVU diskette should be loaded onto 
your personal computer's hard drive. It is recommended that a separate working directing be 
used. While using RUNPLUVU, you have the option of aborting the program at any time by 
pressing the control (Ctrl) and "C" key (e.g., Ctrl-C) at the same time. 

To start a session, the user simply types RUNPLUVU:

Various options in PLUVUE II cause the number of lines in the input file to vary. 
Therefore, entry code 15 may not write the 15th line in the input file. The system will accept 
several formats for the GOTO nn command. The GOTO can be in either upper or lower 
case, but must not have a space between GO and TO. The number for the entry code can be 
entered with or without a decimal, but should be preceded by only one space. The entry code 
for the end of the program is 39. The system will branch to the end of the modification 
portion of the system for any value of nn equal to or greater than 39. Also, it is possible to 
branch to the end of the program, write the output file, then branch to an earlier entry code 
for continued data entry. This makes it possible to save intermediate stages of the data to 
guard against data loss. The new user may wish to enter GOTO 1 at the final prompt. This 
makes it possible to review all values to be written to the output file by entering a succession 
of carriage returns. Finally, the system will accept data entries with or without a decimal 
point, regardless of whether the variables are floating point numbers or integers in the input 
to PLUVUE II. The use of a decimal point is required only when there are digits following a 
decimal point. 

As an example, if the user only wished to change the wind speed, then the user would: 

(1) type GOTO 2, (2) enter the new wind speed followed by the ENTER key, and (3) GOTO 
39 to exit. The user is then notified that the PLUIN2 output file (which is the PLUv.uE II

After the user has s~pplied the PLUVUE II input file name or has modified an 
existing PLUVUE II input file, the user will then be prompted regarding the use or creation 
of a Mie library file: 

The default Mie library as input to PLUVUE II contains the following:

If the user wishes to use the default Mie library, then the following question should be 
answered as yes ("Y" or "y"): 

64 


Do you wish to use the default Mie library (Y or N)? 

and the program will then proceed to the PLUVUE II portion of the run system. The default 
Mie library should be sufficient for the majority of visibility analyses. The use of other 
values for the sigma, radius, and indices of refraction should be approved by the local EPA 
regional office. 

If the user wishes to supply a Mie library file, then the following question should be 
answered in the affirmative ("Y" or "y"): 

Do you wish to supply a Mie library file (Y or N)? 

and then the user will be prompted to enter the Mie library file name: 

Enter the Mie library file name (up to 24 characters):

Make sure to supply the full path name of the file, if the file resides in adirectory other than 
the one you are working in. 

If the J.lSer does not wish to use the default Mie library nor wishes to supply a Mie 
library file, then the fmal option is to create a Mie library file: 

Do you wish to create a Mie library ftle (Y or N)? 

If the user wishes to create a Mie library file, then the run command system will enter the 
MIETBL portion of the code. The following message will first appear:

3.3 
Level-3 Visibility Modeling Example 
This example is provided only for instructional purposes regarding the Level-3 
visibility modeling methodology. Each visibility modeling study is different; therefore, the 
approach used must be discussed before the start of any study with the appropriate EPA 
regional office, state permitting agency, and/or Federal Land Manager. 

3.3.1 
Overview 
This example outlines the steps performed in a Level 3 visibility analysis to analyze 
the visual impacts associated with the exploration, construction, and operation of a nuclear 
waste repository site at a canyon location near a national park. The PLUVUE-II model was 
applied to calculate the magnitude of plume visual effects, including visual range reduction, 
plume contrast, plume coloration, and plume perceptibility, associated with various 
orientations of the plume with respect to potential observers, the sun, and terrain viewing 
backgrounds. The visual impact magnitudes were then combined with frequency distributions 
of meteorological conditions to assess the frequency distribution of plume visual impact using 
the Level-3 analysis guidance in EPA's Workbook for Plume Visual Impact Screening and 
Analysis (Revised) (EPA, 1992). 

The Level-l and -2 screening criteria were exceeded, suggesting that the possibility of 
adverse visibility impairment could not be ruled out without more detailed analysis. As 
opposed to the more cursory and conservative assessment of potential, worst-case visual 
impacts performed for Level-l and -2 visibility screening analyses, the Level-3 analysis is a 
more detailed assessment of plume visual impacts. The Level-3 analysis uses the more 
sophisticated plume visibility model, PLUVUE II, to calculate the magnitude of plume 
visibility impacts for a variety of meteorological conditions that might be encountered in a 
year. These magnitudes of impact are then combined with the frequency of occurrence of 
corresponding conditions to estimate the frequency of occurrence of plume visual impacts. 
Because computer software has not yet been developed to iterate through the hourly 
meteorological conditions encountered in a year, the Levyl-3 analysis is performed by 
sampling a variety of possible plume transport conditions. 

This example is complex for the following reasons: 

1) 
The potential emissions source, a proposed nuclear waste repository site, is to 
be located less than 2 km from the nearest Federal Class I PSD area for which 
visibility is an important value. 

2) , 
The emission source consists of emissions that are not continuous and that vary 
considerably (1) diurnally, due to variations in activity throughout the day, with 
maximum activities during daylight hours, (2) monthly due to different activity 
levels, and (3) over longer time frames corresponding to the exploratory shaft 

69. 

facility (ESF) construction, repository construction (RC), and repository 
operation (RO). Because the emissions are considerably less l;lt night, the 
opportunity for significant impacts resulting from long transport during 
nocturnal, stable, drainage flows is considerably less than for continuous 
emission sources such as power plants. 
3) The emission source is not a point source, but is an area source, distributed 
over many acres with the areas changing depending on the phase of operation 
(ESF, RC, RO). Thus, emissions are initially diluted over a significant vertical 
and horizontal area. · 
4) A significant fraction of the emissions from the source are diesel exhaust 
emissions which are largely fine organic particulate (soot) which has a 
significant light absorbing effect. The Level-l and -2 screening techniques are 
not capable of addressing this component; thus, the more sophisticated 
PLUVUE-11 model was applied. 
5) The area is characterized by very complex terrain. The emission source will be 
located in a canyon. All observation points in the national park are located 
either well above the location of the canyon site or at locations where the 
plume would need to travel a circuitous route, either up and over or around 
significant terrain obstacles such as ridges, canyon walls, and mountains. Su~h 
a complex terrain setting (1) limits the distance an observer can see in certain 
directions, (2) creates a viewing background of terrain (which can be snow 
covered, sunlit, or in shadow), (3) enhances dispersion due to mechanical 
mixing effects, and (4) blocks flows, particularly stable flows, in certain 
directions. 
6) There is interest in the visual impact not only at the closest park boundary, as 
analyzed in the Level-l and -2 screening calculations, but also at more distant, 
but more frequently visited, locations farther in the park. 

The user needs to review a full range of possible conditions (i.e., time of day, season, 
meteorological conditions, and observer locations). Therefore, for this example, over 250 
PLUVUE-11 runs have been made to attempt to characterize the variety of plume visual 
impacts that might occur. For each of the over 250 PLUVUE-U runs, visual impact 
calculations were made for several azimuths of view corresponding to different distances of 
the plume downwind from the source. In addition, an attempt was made to model the effect 
of viewing background, that is, whether it is a sky or white, gray, or black terrain object 

70 



3.3.2 Site Location and Receptors 
The location of the proposed nuclear waste repository site is in a canyon near the 
eastern boundary of a national park. The repository site is located approximately 1.9 km east 
of the eastern park boundary at an elevation of approximately 5160 ft MSL. Three observer 
locations are used in this study. Observer #1 was selected to represent the impact at the 
closest park boundary to the repository site. This observer location is likely to have the worst 
visual impacts because it is only 1.9 km from the center of the proposed site and it has a 
relatively unobstructed view down the canyon toward the site. Although this site is likely to 
have the worst magnitude and frequency of visual impacts, in reality the site may rarely, if 
ever, be visited. Observer #2 was chosen at a location that is visited by 4 percent of the 
national park visitors. The site is approximately 4 km from Observer #1 and 6 km from the 
canyon site. Finally, the third observer (#3) is immediately adjacent to the ranger station on 
the entrance road to the national park. This site was chosen because, although it is further 
from the canyon site (approximately 9 km), it is visited quite often and has a relatively 
unobstructed view in several directions. This area is visited by 12 percent of the park visitors 
and more visitors drive past this location. 

3.3.3 Model Inputs and Assumptions 
Emissions 

The three phases of construction and operation of the proposed nuclear waste 
repository include the following: 

Exploratory Shaft Facility (ESF) Construction 

Repository Construction (RC) 

Repository Operation (RO) 

The emissions data encompass all stationary and mobile emission sources used at the site 
during these three phases. Emissions data do not include estimates of natural wind-blown 
dust; thus, such natural dust sources are not considered in this visibility impact analysis. It 
may be likely that the construction and operation activities will disturb the natural soil 
conditions of the area, thereby increasing the quantity of wind-blown dust. However, as will 
be shown later, the maximum impacts estimated in this analysis occur with light winds (less 
than 3 m/s) which are not likely to be strong enough to raise wind-blown dust. To the extent 
wind-blown dust is added to the line of sight in which the sight emissions are located, visual 
impacts may be diminished due to the obscuring effect of the dust. Therefore, it is believed 
that the exclusion of wind-blown dust is a conservative assumption for this analysis. 

71 



The species of emissions include nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (S02), and 
particulate. There are two categories of particulate considered: (1) diesel engine exhaust and 

(2) fugitive dust. Because the S02 emissions are minute and because S02 requires several 
hours before it is converted to sulfate aerosol which interacts with light (thus potentially 
impairing visibility), this species was not modeled for this example. The particulate emission 
classes were modeled separately as two distinct aerosol modes. The diesel exhaust was 
assumed to be elemental carbon, which is an effective light absorber. The mass median 
diameter of the emitted elemental carbon (soot) from diesel engines was calculated from 
California Air Resources Board (CARB) emission factors to ·be at a mass median diameter of 
0.4 pm, which is near the most effective size range for both light scattering and absorption. 
Fugitive dust emissions were also sized using CARB 's emission factors with a mass median 
diameter of 5.2 pm, which is consistent with other estimates of coarse mode aerosol size 
distribution. 
These emissions vary both diurnally (with maximum emissions generally during the 
daylight hours) and on a month-to-month basis during any given phase. Daily emission 
values for the month with highest emissions in the particular year of the given phase of 
operation with the highest emissions were used as the starting point for emissions 
calculations. The specific emissions used as PLUVUE II input for each of the three phases 
are listed in Table 3. Emissions are greatest during the reppsitory construction phase, with 
NOx emissions of 2.75 tons per day, diesel exhaost emissions of 0.28 tons per day, and 
fugitive dust emissions of 0.61 tons per day. These emission rates are more than three times 
the emissions during the ESF construction, the phase with the next highest emissions. 
Emissions during the repository operation are the lowest. 

For this example, emissions are treated as area sources. ESF construction emissions 
were distributed over 60 acres and repository construction and operation emissions were 
distributed over the entire 400 acres of the site. 

Terrain 

The complex terrain surrounding the canyon site and the three observation sites 
selected for analysis in this study complicates the realistic analysis of the visual impacts in 
the following ways: 

1) 
Complex terrain will tend to dramatically effect the transport and dispersion of 
emissions. Elevated terrain will block and channel the airflow, especially 
during stable conditions. Also, elevated, rugged terrain tends to enhance 
diffusion because of mechanical mixing effects and because plume parcels are 
more easily torn apart and transported in different directions.

2) Complex terrain will limit the direction and distance an observer can see in a 
given direction. Terrain obstacles may prevent an observer from seeing plumes 
that would be readily visible to an observer located on flat terrain or on an 
elevated vantage point. 
3) Complex terrain will become the viewing background for many plumes. 
Terrain is either a viewing obstruction or a viewing background depending on 
whether the plume material is in front of or behind a given terrain object. 

Observer #1 has a direct view of the canyon site, unobstructed by intervening terrain. 
Observer #2's view is obstructed by elevated terrain at approximately 4 km, and Observer 
#3's view is obstructed by terrain approximately 9 km from the observer. Terrain 
obstructions in all directions from the three observer locations were considered in this 
analysis. If a plume would be located in a position that would be obstructed from view by 
intervening terrain, its visual impact was assigned to zero. 

Meteorological Conditions 

Since meteorological data were not available for the canyon site or for any of the three 
observer locations used in this example, meteorological data from the closest monitoring she 
was used to characterize the frequency of occurrence of various meteorological conditions. 
The worst year of the available annual meteorological data were used to calculate tables of 
joint frequency of wind direction and speed and atmospheric ·stability for specific time periods 
of interest. The worst-case dispersion conditions were ranked in order of decreasing severity 
and the frequency of occurrence of these conditions associated with the wind direction that 
could transport emissions toward the Class I area. Dispersion conditions were ranked by 
evaluating the product crycrzu, where cry and crz are the Pasquill-Gifford horizontal and vertical 
dispersion coefficients for the given stability class and downwind distance x along the stable 
plume trajectory, and u is the maximum wind speed for the given wind speed category in the 
joint frequency table. The frequency of occurrence analysis was conducted for the following 
worst-case meteorological conditions: 

Pasquill-Gifford Wind 
Stability Class Speed (rn/s) 

F 1,2,3 
E 1,2,3,4,5 
D 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 

The dispersion conditions were ranked in ascending order of the value crycrzu. The joint


frequency tables were prepared for each observer location at three different downwind 

distances. The transport time from the emissions source to each observer location was 

calculated along the minimum trajectory distance based on the midpoint value of wind speed 

74 



for each wind speed category. For example, for the wind speed category 0-1 rn/s, a wind 
speed of 0.5 rn/s was used to evaluate the transport time. 

It is unlikely that steady-state plume conditions will persist for more than 12 hours. 
Thus, if a transit time of more than 12 hours is required to transport a plume parcel from the 
emissions source to the observer locations for a given dispersion condition, it was assumed 
that plume material is more dispersed than a standard Gaussian plume model would predict. 
The frequencies associated with transport times longer than 12 hours were not included in the 
cumulative frequency summations. 

To obtain the worst-case meteorological conditions, it was necessary to determine the 
dispersion condition (a given wind speed and stability class associated with the wind direction 
that would transport emissions toward the observer locations) that has a apzu product with a 
cumulative probability of one percent. In other words, the dispersion condition was selected 
such that the sum of all frequencies of occurrence of conditions worse than this condition 
totals one percent (i.e., about four days per year). The one-percentile meteorology is assumed 
to be indicative of worst-day plume visual impacts when the probability of worst-case : 
meteorological conditions is coupled with the probability of other factors being ideal for 
maximizing plume visual impacts. Dispersion conditions associated with transport times of 
more than 12 hours ~ere not considered in this cumulative frequency for the reasons stated 
above. 

Emissions due to repository construction and operation principally occur during 
daylight hours, thus nighttime dispersion conditions are irrelevant for this study. (This would 
not be the case for a continuous emission source whose nighttime emissions could be caught 
in very stable flows and transported intact to long distances, as occurs with power plant 
emissions, for example.) For this example, emissions from daytime activities start at 0800 so 
the daylight hours were divided into three-hour periods starting at 0800 for cumulative 
frequency calculations. The poorest daylight dispersion conditions were found to occur in the 
morning for the first 3-hour period (0800-1100). Therefore, the analysis of the frequency of 
impacts were conducted for the morning (0800-1 fOO) period. 

3.3.4 Model Results 
Over 250 PLUVUE-11 model calculations of plume visual impact were performed to 
attempt to characterize the ranges of potential visual impacts for a variety of times of 
day/season, observer positions, and meteorological and emissions conditions. PLUVUE II 
calculates a number of parameters that quantify the visual effect of a plume of given 
dimensions, position (relative to the observer, the sun, and viewing backgrounds), and 
concentration. These parameters are calculated for each downwind distance considered in the 
model. In this example, downwind distances of 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 km were considered. 
Visual impacts were calculated from the separate perspectives associated with the three 
observers. The four parameters used to characterize the visibility effects of the plume 

75 



included: visual range reduction, plume contrast, blue-red ratio, and ~E. The importance of 
these parameters was discussed in Section 1. 

Table 4 summarizes the results of the first PLUVUE-ll calculations that were 
performed to determine which of the emitted species (NOx, diesel exhaust, or fugitive dust) 
caused the most impact. This determination was made by first modeling all emissions and 
then modeling separately the impacts of each emitted species alone. As expected, the base 
case (with all emitted species considered) produced the maximum visual impacts. Visual 
range was reduced 15%, plume contrast was most negative ( -0.016), blue-red ratio was the 
lowest (0.987), and, as a result of the contrast and color change, the plume ~was highest 
(0.641). The values of these parameters indicate that for this particular condition the plume 
would not be visible since ~is less than 1 but that it would be slightly darker (negative 
contrast) and yellower (blue-red ratio less than 1) than the assumed sky background. 

Diesel exhaust considered alone caused the next largest impact, nearly as great as all 
species combined. The values of the parameters suggest a darkening effect of the plume. 
This is not surprising considering that diesel exhaust particulate is elemen~al carbon (soot) 
which is a very effective light absorber. 

Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions caused nearly as large an impact as the diesel exhaust, 
again a· darkening effect due to the light absorbing nature of the nitrogen dioxide molecule. 

Fugitive dust had a much lower impact than either diesel exhaust particulates or NOx 
because the particulate is relatively large and therefore not an effective light scatterer. 
Fugitive dust, which acts to scatter light both into and out of the line of sight, when present 
with the light absorbing soot and NOx, may actually tend to mask some of the effect of the 
other emitted species. Thus, for this example, we conclude that the diesel exhaust particulate 
(largely soot) and NOx from the construction and operation activities at the site are the 
principal causes of plume visual impacts calculated in this study. However, it should be 
noted that visual impacts of fugitive dust would be most noticeable against a dark terrain 
viewing background (e.g., a terrain feature in shadow) in which case the particulate, 
especially when the sun is in front of the observer, would scatter light into the line of sight 
thereby appearing brighter than the terrain. 

As discussed, over 250 PLUVUE-II runs were made. For each run, plume visual 
effects were made for the particular vantage point of one of the three observers in the national 
park. Each run was based on a particular plume position appropriate for the given wind 
direction. Calculations were performed for six downwind distances. An input file for one of 
the many runs is shown in Figure 10. The corresponding output is shown in Figure 11. In 
this example, Observer #1 would observe the indicated plume visual effect as the plume was 
scanned from the closest downwind distance to the most distant. Thus, the indicated effects 
at given distances along the plume can also be interpreted as effects for various azimuths of 
view.

After the PLUVUE II runs were completed, a check was made to determine whether 
elevated terrain existed between the observer and the location of the plume. If the plume 
would not have been visible due to intervening terrain, visual effects were set to zero. Tables 
5 and 6 summarize the maximum~ values for each of the PLUVUE II runs for Observers 
#1, #2, and #3. In Table 5, the first series of runs, shown by the matrix of calculations 
running across the top of the table, was done to determine the sensitivity of visual effects to 
sun angle (i.e., time of day and season). This sensitivity analysis indicated that visual impacts 
are not strong functions of sun angle; however, slightly higher magnitudes of effects were 
noted for the winter morning sun angle. Therefore, subsequent runs were performed for this 
time of day/year. The next set of runs were performed to test the sensitivity to atmospheric 
stability and wind speed. Because of the distributed nature of the area sources in this 
example, plume visual effects were relatively insensitive to stability. This is because the 
plume L\E values occurred generally at the closest downwind distance where plume 
dimensions were defmed by the initial dilution of the area source. However, visual effects 
were found to be sensitive to wind speed, with~ decreasing with increasing wind speed. 
The final set of calculations sampled the visual effects associated with various wind 
directions, wind speeds, and emissions corresponding to the three phases of operation: 
exploratory shaft facility construction (ESF), repository construction (RC), and repository 
operation (RO). · 

Table 6 shows the results of PLUVUE II runs performed to characterize the visual 
effects observed from the vantage points of Observers #2 and #3. For this example, 
calculations were performed for neutral (Stability Class D) conditions only because it is 
believed that elevated terrain would block the transport of stable plumes within view of these 
observers and, if stable flow did occur, mechanically induced turbulence caused by the flow 
over the rugged, elevated terrain would produce the equivalent of D stability conditions. 
Calculations were also performed for the winter morning (0800) sun angle, for a range of 
wind speeds and directions, and for each of the three phases of construction and operation. 

Table 7 displays in descending order the calculated maximum plume L\E values for 
each obsenier position and each phase of repository construction and operation. Generally, 
the maximum visual impact occurs when the winds are most light and the plume is carried to 
the observer. 

The magnitudes of the plume visual impact, as characterized by the plume L\E, were 
combined with meteorological data to estimate the frequency of occurrence of worst-case 
impacts for each of the three observers. This compilation is summarized in Table 8. For 
each of the three observers, the maximum and average (across all azimuths of view) plume 
visual impacts are summarized for five meteorological conditions and for each of the three 
phases. The five meteorological conditions for each observer were selected from the larger 
sample of meteorological conditions, as discussed in the meteorology discussion in Section 
3.3.3, to provide a range of L\E values and cumulative frequencies. All combinations of wind 
speed and wind direction that yielded L\E values greater than the indicated values were 
summed to assign a cumulative frequency for each meteorological condition. The cumulative

frequencies were determined separately for each season as well as for the annual period. The 
cumulative frequency values shown in Table 8 are percentages of morning hours (0800-1100) 
. which were found to be worst-case for this example. 

For Observer #1 the maximum and azimuth-average plume visual impacts are 
essentially the same, because this observer's line of sight is limited to just the first few 
downwind distances modeled. Maximum plume .1E values of about 8 occur nearly 10 percent 
of the morning hours from this vantage point during repository construction. During ESF 
construction and repository operation, impacts· are much lower--about 5 and 2, respectively. 
Nearly a third of the morning .1E values of approximately 4 are calculated to occur from the 
Observer #1 vantage point during the construction of the ESF and the repository. During the 
repository operation, the plume .1E values would be greater than 1 less than a third of the 
morning hours. If we use the range of .1E between 1 and 4 as the approximate threshold of 
plume perceptibility, these results suggest that the plume would be visible from the vantage 
point of Observer #1 between a third and two-thirds of the mornings in the year. However, 
these impacts may not be perceptible this often if the viewing background is dark and/or 
nonuniform. Essentially all of these observations of plume impact would be of emissions 
located outside the park boundary while observed within the park boundary. Impacts vary 
with season with most frequent impacts occurring during the winter and least "frequent impacts 
during the more· windy spring and summer seasons. Impacts are much less frequent in the 
afternoon hours than in the morning for Observer #1. Values of .1E greater than 8 occur only 
one percent of the afternoon hours (as opposed to 10 percent of the morning hours). Values 
of .1E greater than 4 occur 8 percent of the afternoons as opposed to a third of the mornings. 

For Observer #2, predicted frequencies of visible impacts are lower than for Observer 
#1, which is not surprising considering that thi~ vantage point does not have a direct view of 
and is farther away from the canyon site. Somewhat more surprising, however, is the fact 
that for certain azimuths of view, maximum plume visual impacts are larger than maximum 
impacts for Observer #1. This results from the fact that this vantage point offers relatively 
unobstructed lines of sight along which the plume from the repository site can be seen. The 
maximum plume impacts occur when the wind carries the plume relatively close to the 
observer and when the observer is looking obliquely through the plume centerline. Unlike the 
case for Observer #1, the average plume impact, averaged over all azimuths of view for 
which the plume is unobstructed by intervening terrain, is considerably lower than the plume 
impact for the worst-case azimuth of view. Azimuth-averaged plume .1E values are roughly a 
factor of five lower than the azimuth-maximum values. These calculations suggest that 
during repository construction and operation, about one percent of the mornings in a year may 

-have maximum plume .1E values as large or larger than 25, indicating a very dark, perceptible 
plume. These maximum impacts would be about five times larger than the average over all 
visible directions of view, which is a .1E of about 5, still above the perceptibility threshold 
range of 1 to 4. Impacts during ESF construction are projected to be considerably lower. For 
about two percent of the morning hours, impacts would be greater than or equal to 17 
(azimuth-maximum) and 4 (azimuth-average). During repository construction, maximum 
plume visual impacts would be greater than the just perceptible threshold range of 1 to 4 

103 


between 15 and 20 percent of the morning hours in the year. For this observation point, 
summer impacts would be almost twice as frequent as annual-average impacts due to the 
increased p~obability of transport winds of the right magnitude and direction. 

Impacts for Observer #3 are somewhat similar to those for Observer #2, both in 
magnitude and frequency. Maximum impacts --plume ~values of about 28 --are 
calculated to occur about two percent of the mornings, while impacts above the perceptibility 
threshold are calculated to occur about 20 percent of the mornings. Again, impacts from the 
vantage point of Observer #3 are much more frequent in summer than in any other season. 
For example, above-threshold impacts occur nearly 30 percent of the summer mornings.
