		  PLUVUE II (dated 24242)

     This Model Change Bulletin initiates the use of the
PLUVUE II model (dated 24242).  This version supersedes the
previous version (dated 96170).

     The revised PLUVUE II model (dated 24242) updates the model
and its associated preprocessor programs so that they can run on 
32-bit and 64-bit Windows Operating Systems and be portable to
other more modern operating systems.

Several other updates have been performed:

  1)	The two PLUVUE2 User’s Guides in PDF format on SCRAM have
         been converted to text searchable PDF documents.
  2)	Minor corrects were made to all three main programs.
  3)	The Input/Output structures were changed so that there is
         no reliance of reading of filenames from the 
         Command Line.
  4)	Instructions were prepared for testing and running the
         PLUVUE2 programs, Pluvue2Instructions.pdf.
  5)	The RUNPLUVUE program was dropped due to users’
         suggestions that it was more of a hindrance than a help.
  6)   A line of text was added as the firt line to the MIETBL 
         input file.  That line of text can be up to 80 
         characters long and be used for data identification.


The user is advised to down load the various files from SCRAM. 
It would be easiest to place the executables and test cases in
just one subdirectory.

If you have any questions, please use the Contact Us page on
SCRAM.

     This program will henceforth be identified by its name
and a Julian date, i.e., PLUVUE II (dated 24242).  Future
changes to this model will be identified by an updated
Julian date found after the first few lines of the model
source code and followed by a reference to a SCRAM BBS Model
Change Bulletin Number (MCB#n)which will explain the nature
and contents of the changes.  All MCB's for this program
will always be available for back reference on this BBS.  In
the future, notification of changes to this program will be
made in the SCRAM ALERTS section of this BBS immediately
following the LOGON procedure.  A new Model Change Bulletin
will ONLY be issued when there is a change to the model
source code.  Changes to test cases that are included in the
archived file will be addressed and appropriately identified
in an amendment to the model's latest MCB with notification
posted in the SCRAM ALERTS section of the BBS.
