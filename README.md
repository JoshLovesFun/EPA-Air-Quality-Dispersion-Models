# EPA-Air-Quality-Dispersion-Models
This repository contains an UNOFFICIAL archive of the United States Environmental Protection Agency air quality dispersion models.

Every effort has been made to ensure that the code of the models provided here is identical to the code contained on the EPA's website:
https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling

This repository is an archive of the models. As such, pull requests are allowed, but will NEVER be merged into a model archive and will be closed.
This repository will be updated when the EPA releases new versions of the models.
