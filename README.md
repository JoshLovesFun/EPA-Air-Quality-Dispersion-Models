# EPA-Air-Quality-Dispersion-Models

This repository contains an **UNOFFICIAL** archive of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) air quality dispersion models. It also serves as a reference point for proposed or suggested changes to these models.

Every effort has been made to ensure that the code of the models provided here is identical to the code available on the EPA's website:  
[Air Quality Dispersion Modeling - EPA](https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling)

## Repository Purpose

The main branch of this repository is strictly an archive of the models. As such, while pull requests are allowed, they will **NEVER** be merged into the main branch and will be closed. The primary reason for this is to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the model archives. The main branch of this repository will be updated only when the EPA releases new versions of the models.

> **Note:** This repository does not include the PDF documentation associated with each model version. These documents will be stored in a separate repository:  
> [**Repository for Model Documentation**](https://github.com/JoshLovesFun/EPA-Air-Quality-Dispersion-Model-Documentation)

## Contribution Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to fork this repository and make changes. However, please note that code in the main branch of this repository will **NEVER** be modified. The only exceptions to this rule are:

- Adding the latest EPA model versions.

If you would like to contribute and further develop the EPA models, please follow the steps below:

1. **Fork this repository.**  
   Create a fork of this repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Make changes to the code.**

3. **Create a pull request.**  
   Submit a pull request from your development branch in your forked repository to the main branch of your forked repository.

4. **Alert me.**  
   Add me as a contributor to your forked repository. I will approve the pull request (even if the code is incorrect or inappropriate) and create a new branch in this repository with a fitting name.

5. **Propose changes to the EPA.**  
   I do not have the authority to recommend any changes to the EPA. If you wish to propose your modifications, you can contact the EPA directly and provide a link to the branch containing your changes. Note that the EPA is not using this repository for their model development, so you will need to coordinate with them to determine if your changes align with their updates.
