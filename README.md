# EPA-Air-Quality-Dispersion-Models
This repository contains an UNOFFICIAL archive of the United States Environmental Protection Agency air quality dispersion models.
The goal here is to provide the community with easy access to the model code, and maintain an archive of old versions of the models.

Every effort has been made to ensure that the code of the models provided here is identical to the code contained on the EPA's website:
https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling

This repository is an archive of the models. As such, pull requests are allowed, but will **NEVER** be merged into the main branch and will be closed.
The reason for this, is because I want to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the model archives.
This repository will be updated when the EPA releases new versions of the models.
