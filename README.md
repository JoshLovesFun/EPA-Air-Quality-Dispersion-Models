# EPA-Air-Quality-Dispersion-Models
This repository contains an UNOFFICIAL archive of the United States Environmental Protection Agency air quality dispersion models.
The goal here is to provide the community with easy access to the model code, and maintain an archive of old versions of the models.

Every effort has been made to ensure that the code of the models provided here is identical to the code contained on the EPA's website:
https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling

This repository is an archive of the models. As such, pull requests are allowed, but will **NEVER** be merged into the main branch and will be closed.
The reason for this, is because I want to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the model archives.
This repository will be updated when the EPA releases new versions of the models.

Anyone is allowed to make Forks of this repository, and do as they wish. Anyone can also open issues, but note that code in the main branch
will **NEVER** be modififed. They only changes that are allowed in the main branch are updates to the "README.md" document, and adding the
latest EPA model versions to the main branch.

If you would like to contribute and further develop the EPA models, here is a suggested course of action:
1. Start by creating a fork of this repository.
2. Make changes to the code as you wish.
3. Create a pull request from within your forked repository from the branch that is in development, to the main branch.
4. Alert me, by adding me as a contributor to your forked repository. I will approve the pull request (even if the code is wrong
5. or inappropriate), and make a new branch in my repository that will be named appropriately.
