     The Shoreline Dispersion Model (SDM) is a multipoint Gaussian dispersion
model that can be used to determine ground-level concentrations from tall
stationary point source emissions near a shoreline environment where plumes
emitted into stable air regimes are transported to and through shoreline
thermal boundaries.  On the other side of the boundary, the plumes are rapidly
diffused to the ground causing plume fumigation.  Ground-level concentrations
can become very high for long periods of time.  SDM was designed to model
these types of fumigation cases.  SDM is used in conjunction with MPTER
algorithms to calculate concentrations when fumigation conditions do not
exist.

     SDM can model up to 250 sources and 180 receptors. Hourly meteorological
data is needed from a tower located on or near the shoreline.  The
meteorological data used are in both the standard RAMMET preprocessor format
and a special format for the shoreline model.

     The Shoreline Dispersion Model (SDM) was tested on an IBM PC/AT
compatible with 640K memory and an Intel 80287 math coprocessor.  The model
was compiled and tested with both Microsoft FORTRAN 77 (Version 5.0) and Lahey
FORTRAN 77 (Version 4.0).  When using the Lahey FORTRAN 77 compiler, the /R/
switch should be used when compiling and line SDM0101 needs to be uncommented.
Instructions for executing SDM on an IBM 3090 are available in the user's
guide.

     In order to use SDM, the user should obtain the following:

     User's Guide to SDM - A Shoreline Dispersion Model
     EPA-450/4-88-017 (NTIS PB89-164305), September, 1988

     Errata Sheets for the User's Guide to SDM 
     (Available from NTIS after February 15, 1991)

     Four Diskettes:
         1) SDM      Fortran and Executable (Microsoft) Code
         2) SDM      Test #1 Input and Output Files
         3) SDM      Test #2 Input and Output Files
         4) SDMMET   SDM Meteorological Data Preprocessor
                     Fortran and Executable (Microsoft) Code
                     Test Input and Output Files

                              OR

          Download the SDM code and files from the SCRAM BBS file transfer
          section. The archival names are SDM01 and SDM02.


     In order to run SDMMET (SDM Meteorological Data Preprocessor), two input
files are required:

          SDMMET.INP     SDMMET Input Control File (Mandatory)
          TOWER.MET      Hourly Tower Meteorological Data (Mandatory)

     Once the appropriate input files have been prepared, the user simply has
to type SDMMET to activate the program.  SDMMET outputs one file in either
binary or ascii depending upon the response given to the interactive
question.  The output file is:

          TOWER.ASC      Ascii SDM Tower Meteorological Data
       OR
          TOWER.BIN      Binary SDM Tower Meteorological Data


     For the SDM test cases, the regulatory defaults were chosen for all
input options except for IOPT(5).  IOPT(5) is set to 1 so that the surface
meteorological data may be input in card image form.

     Two SDM test cases are supplied:

     Test #1  One Year of hourly meteorological data
              Takes approximately 20 minutes to run on an IBM-PC/AT
              compatible computer with a math coprocessor chip

     Test #2  One Week of hourly meteorological data
              Takes approximately 1 minute to run on an IBM-PC/AT
              compatible computer with a math coprocessor chip

     In order to run the SDM test case,

       1) rename the input1 or input2 files to input
       2) rename the tower1.asc or tower2.asc to tower.asc
       3) type sdm

     A summary of the input files which may be required (depending upon the
options selected) to run SDM are listed below:

          INPUT          SDM Input Control File (Mandatory)
          TOWER.BIN OR TOWER.ASC
                         Tower Meteorological File (Mandatory)
          MET            Binary RAMMET Surface Meteorological Data ((IOPT(5)
                           or IOPT(25) = 1)
          EMISSIONS      Binary Hourly Emissions Data (IOPT(6) = 1)

     Once the appropriate input files have been prepared, the user simply has
to type SDM to activate the program.  A summary of output file names which
may be produced (depending upon the options selected) are listed below:

          SDM.OUT        SDM Output Listing
          SDM.FUM        SDM Fumigation Summary

          AVGCONCS       Binary Averaging Time Concentrations (IOPT(23) = 1)
