                            TSCREEN (dated 91098)



    Three source code files have been affected by the problems recently
encountered in the TSCREEN model.  These files are TSMAIN.BAS, S5.BAS, and
GRAF.BAS.  All three files are written in a structured BASIC format (ie no
line numbers).  


     NOTE:  Normally, line numbers or sequence identifiers would enable
     the user to edit simple changes, such as the ones below, into the
     previous source codes with a high degree of confidence.  However,
     the lack of formal line identification makes this task riskier.  For
     example, any line identification displayed with the changes listed
     below, refers to line numbering extracted from a printout generated
     by a computer program that compared the previous GRAF.BAS source
     code with the revised GRAF.BAS source code and printed the
     differences out. Any software that the user uses may not produce the
     same line numbering sequence. 


     THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE USER DOWNLOAD THE REVISED
     FILES FROM SCRAM BBS INSTEAD OF MAKING CHANGES FROM THE INFORMATION
     BELOW.


    The only major correction is in subroutine S5.BAS which affects
calulations for Scenario 4.5, Continuous Gaseous Leaks from Tanks/Pipes.  A
pair of parentheses were inadvertently omitted from an exponential expression
which is used to determine whether to use a critical or subcritical flow rate
equation.  Read page 4.9 of "A Workbook of Screening Techniques for Assessing
Impacts of Toxic Air Pollutants" for more technical information on this
equation and scenario.

    Some minor problems with the functioning of TSCREEN's save and graph
functions were alleviated. 



                         *** TSMAIN.BAS Changes ***
    

    The SCRAM BBS header for TSCREEN has been changed from:

' *                         TSCREEN (DATED 91067)                           *
' *             *** SEE TSCREEN MODEL CHANGE BULLETIN MCB#2 ***             *

to:

' *                         TSCREEN (DATED 91098)                           *
' *             *** SEE TSCREEN MODEL CHANGE BULLETIN MCB#3 ***             *




                           *** S5.BAS Changes ***


     In the subroutine, S5.BAS, a pair of parentheses were inadvertently
omitted from the exponential expression in the following expression.  The
expression was changed from:

IF VAL(pt$) / VAL(pad$) < ((VAL(k$) + 1) / 2) ^ VAL(k$) / (VAL(k$) - 1) THEN

to:

IF VAL(pt$) / VAL(pad$) < ((VAL(k$) + 1) / 2) ^ (VAL(k$) / (VAL(k$) - 1)) THEN





                              *** GRAF.BAS ***

     In the program GRAF.BAS, the following changes were made:


1) Prior to the following line (old line 24):

                     END IF



     Revised executable files, GRAF.EXE, TSCREEN.EXE, and TSMAIN.EXE were
generated from the revised source code files.  The revised files replaced
their older versions in various archival (compressed) files.  GRAF.EXE was
packed into the archival file, TSCRN01.ZIP.  TSCREEN.EXE and TSMAIN.EXE were
packed into archival files, TSCRN02.ZIP, and TSCRN03.ZIP, respectively.  The
revised source codes, GRAF.BAS and S5.BAS together with the previously omitted
files, GRAPH.C, LOPTION0, and TSCREEN.C were packed into archival files,
TSCRN04.ZIP and TSCRN05.ZIP.  All five files are available from the Screening
Models section of the SCRAM BBS.  Only the files in archival files
TSCRN01.ZIP, TSCRN02.ZIP, and TSCRN03.ZIP are needed for running the TSCREEN
model.  The source code files, which are packed into archival files
TSCRN04.ZIP and TSCRN05.ZIP, are not needed for running the TSCREEN model. 
For further details, please read the README file that is part of the
TSCRN02.ZIP archival file.
