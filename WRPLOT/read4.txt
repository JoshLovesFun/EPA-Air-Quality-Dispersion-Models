     The WRPLOT tutorial files are part of the "Instructional Package on
Regulatory Air Quality Modeling - Part II:  Tutorials for Five PC-Based Air
Quality Models and Two Utility Programs," EPA-454/C-92-003.  It contains
instructional materials for the WRPLOT program.

     The WRPLOT tutorial contains the following files:

     (1) INSTALL.EXE - WRPLOT model and demonstration (self-extracting)
     (2) 13722-84.ZIP - Meteorological data for RDU, NC
     (3) 13722-85.ZIP - Meteorological data for RDU, NC
     (4) 13722-86.ZIP - Meteorological data for RDU, NC
     (5) 13722-87.ZIP - Meteorological data for RDU, NC
     (6) 13722-88.ZIP - Meteorological data for RDU, NC
     (7) 13722-89.ZIP - Meteorological data for RDU, NC
     (8) WRPLTTUT.ZIP - Tutorial documentation in WP51
     (9) READ.TXT - Instructions on WRPLOT tutorial.

     In order to execute the WRPLOT tutorial, all of the files listed above
must be downloaded and stored in the same DOS directory (i.e., C:\WRPLOT)
on your PC.

     All files with a "ZIP" extention name must then be unzipped (dearchived)
using the unzip program available for downloading from the System Utilities
menu of the TTN.  The unzip program "PKUNZIP.EXE" must also be stored in the
same DOS directory with the tutorial ZIP files.  Simply type PKUNZIP followed
by a space and the name of the ZIP file and the files included in the ZIP will
be generaged in your DOS directory.  After dearchiving all of the above files,
type WRPLOT to invoke the WRPLOT demonstration.

     Files with the "WPF" extention name are in WordPerfect format and must
be imported into your WordPerfect word processor.  The original documentation
was formatted for an HP LaserJet II series printer.  The pagination of your
printed file may differ due to variations in printer and font types.

     Any questions or comments concerning the WRPLOT tutorial may be directed
to Dennis Atkinson, U.S. EPA, MD-14, Research Triangle Park, N.C.  27711
